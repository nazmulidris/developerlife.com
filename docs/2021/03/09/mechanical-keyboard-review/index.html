          The search for the best programmer’s keyboard <a href="#the-search-for-the-best-programmers-keyboard">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>I type a lot, every day. And I need a keyboard that can help me take care of my hands and body, so
as not to wear anything them out, or cause needless fatigue or repetitive stress injuries.</p>

<p>I used to use the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/">Kinesis Advantage</a>
keyboard for almost a decade from 2000 to 2010. After that I switched to the
<a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/freestyle2-keyboard/">Kinesis Freestyle</a> and finally to
<a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/">Kinesis Freestyle Edge mechanical RGB backlit keyboard</a>
after that came out. So I’ve had a long history with Kinesis 😀.</p>

<p>All that came to an end when I embarked on the search for a more programmer friendly ergonomic
keyboard. Programmer friendly in the sense that I wanted to remap my keys to be whatever I choose,
whether that means swapping keys for other keys, or creating macros, or even working with multiple
keyboard layers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can find an awesome list of split keyboards
<a href="https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first one that I tried was the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a> keyboard, which I didn’t
like at all. The build quality was not that great and the keyboard layout didn’t make much sense to
me. And I didn’t like the software to configure the keyboard either. I liked the ergonomics of the
Kinesis Freestyle Edge much better, even without the ability to customize it much. And the build
quality of the Freestyle Edge RGB was on par with the Ergodox EZ, nothing great, but not bad either.</p>
      <h2 id="keyboard-companions---trackpad-and-mouse">
        
        
          Keyboard companions - trackpad and mouse <a href="#keyboard-companions---trackpad-and-mouse">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Before getting into the keyboard review, I wanted to cover the other input devices I use with them.
I have two input devices that I use with these keyboards. This keyboard does support mouse movement,
but this is not so good for complex mouse movements (great for short movements).</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005620.html">Logitech MX3 Master</a> -
This is the best mouse that I have ever used. Everything about it is amazing. Sadly on Linux
<a href="/2021/03/04/customize-ubuntu/#mouse-customization">customization options are
limited</a>, but you can do
a lot on Windows or macOS w/ customizing the mouse itself.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a> -
Since the UHK has a big gap in the middle, I usually have a trackpad there so that I don’t have
to reach for the mouse to for scrolling a page or some small movements to click on a UI element
on screen. When using drawing apps, then I definitely use the mouse. But this can be cumbersome
for mundane operations like clicking on buttons in IDEA dialog boxes, or just browser operation
(I try to use <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a> to minimize mouse / trackpad interaction in
general). You might also try this
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGFHJDY/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A3VVLG7OTU8AIK&amp;psc=1">trackpad</a>.</li>
</ol>

          Ergonomic mechanical keyboard - UHK v1 <a href="#ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard---uhk-v1">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Then I found out about the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a>. I
thought that was quite a claim in the name when I first heard of it. So I ordered my first one with
very high expectations. I ordered it with the MX Brown switches and the fantastic wrist wrests (made
out of solid wood). And I am happy to report that the name accurately matches the product and my
expectations where blown away! I am a fan for life!</p>

<p>Then I ordered another one, with the ISO keyboard layout instead of the US 😀.</p>

<p>Then I pre-ordered the UHK v2 RGB keyboard, and am now impatiently waiting for the keyboard to come
out, along with the modules. As soon as that happens (expected to start shipping in March 2021) I
will be sure to post a new review (of v2 and the new modules).</p>
      <h3 id="pros">
        
        
          Pros <a href="#pros">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Where to begin about all that is right with this keyboard. Just about everything. The build quality
is outstanding! I ordered the wooden palm rests, which are not only solid and heavy, but look and
feel great. Everything about this keyboard exudes craftsmanship and quality. There is no planned
obsolescence to be found anywhere in this keyboard.</p>

<p>Not only is the physical keyboard itself magnificent, but the
<a href="https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent">UHK Agent</a> software that you use to program it is
just fantastic! It has a really easy to use and powerful UI. The electron based app also supports
Dark Theme 😀. It is just painless to use, and makes it a joy to reprogram the keyboard to whatever
you desire. And you can do firmware updates with ease. And it works on any platform.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how amazing Agent and the UHK are. The Support staff at UHK are awesome as
well, and they helped me to figure this out! By default if you double tap the Fn or Mod keys, they
lock. And you are in that layer until you unlock (by pressing the key that got you into that layer
in the first place). This can be really annoying when accidentally double pressing these layer keys.
Agent simply allows you to change this behavior in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can simply tell Agent to disable the Mod key from sticking if you double press it.</li>
  <li>You can also tell Agent to toggle everytime you press.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you can make it to whatever you like! Here’s a video to illustrate the awesomeness that is UHK
and Agent!</p>

          <del>Cons</del> Nits <a href="#cons-nits">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>I only have nits against this keyboard. Not really cons. The first is that I really miss not having
dedicated cursor keys and a row of Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys. Yes, I know that you can
simply map these keys to another layer like Fn or Mod, or just other individual keys (both of which
I have done) but these keys are so frequently used in GNOME that it would make sense to have them as
dedicated keys. UHK makes modules and they have a module that adds a few keys (that I have on order)
which I hope will address this shortcoming.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>The UHK is so configurable that outside of being happy with the build quality, I really had to think
through how I was going to customize the keyboard to suit my programming needs. I did ask for the
ultimately configurable keyboard, and I did get just that 😀. Now it is on me to devise strategies
to enhance my productivity using this keyboard.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>A new concept that comes with this keyboard (when compared to non programmable keyboards) is the
ability to not only create your own layers, but also create create secondary roles for keys. You can
also control your mouse pointer with the keyboard if you like.</p>
      <h4 id="secondary-roles-for-keys">

<p>Normally we think of a modifier key (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>) as something we press and hold down in addition
to pressing another key. However, in the UHK, if you just tap (press once) the modifier key you can
have it type any other key or combination of keys or a macro!</p>

<p>The following table has two examples for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Space</code> key and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code> key. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Space</code> key behaves
like a normal key, while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code> key is a modifier key that behaves differently if you just press
it once (launches Alfred), vs hold it down while pressing another key (switches to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code> layer).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Tap (press once)</th>
      <th>Hold (long press / press with another key)</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Space</td>
      <td>Space</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Mod</td>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taking the example of a key mapped to “Space” you can only just have one function. If you touch
the key once you expect it to add a space. If you hold it down, you expect it to type many spaces.
So this key is a poor candidate to have any secondary role assigned to it for the following
reasons.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If you assign a modifier key to its secondary role, then you will lose the ability to hold it
down and have it type a bunch of spaces; it will just wait for you to type another key.</li>
    <li>And if you don’t type another key and release the “Space” key, then it will type just one
space.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s another example of secondary roles using both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code> keys on the keyboard. I press
backtick and tilde quite a bit (when editing markdown or when using the terminal to switch folders).
The backtick key is on the top left corner of the keyboard making it quite unergonomic to reach. So
I devised the following keymap to make things ergonomic.</p>

      <td>Left Shift (secondary role)</td>
    </tr>

<p>Not only can you create your own layers, you can also have some layer switching keys lock (rather
than just shift into a layer and back out again when all the keys are released). You can also
activate the mouse pointer in its own mouse layer, or you can just assign these mouse control
functions to any keys in any layer.</p>

<p>One thing that I do is map <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn+O</code> to scroll the mouse down, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn+P</code> to scroll the mouse up. I
also had to create a macro in order to move the mouse pointer to the center of whatever window that
is currently focused. When activated, a macro simply generates a sequence of key events, with delays
if you need them. So for me to move my mouse pointer to the center of whatever window has focus, I
have to press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+F7</code> (GNOME shortcut to move a window), and then press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>. So I created a
macro for this, and mapped it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn</code> layer for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> key.</p>

<p>UHK also supports the ability to have many keyboard layouts (each one has a base, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fn</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mouse</code> layer). This is good for situations where you want to have quite different keymaps for
different operating systems. So you might have a Linux keymap, and a macOS one, and then switch back
and forth between them, much like you do with layers.</p>

<p>Put all this together and you can make some incredibly powerful keyboard shortcuts that you simply
can’t do with a “normal” keyboard. However, it isn’t easy to get this “right” and here are some
caveats (make sure to test your changes):</p>

<ol>
  <li>While you might come up with something really useful, without testing it with yourself, it isn’t
really possible to know whether this is something that will make you more productive, or just get
in your way.</li>
  <li>If you have extensive prior experience with touch typing on normal keyboards, it will be
difficult to break old habits and form new ones.</li>
  <li>There are some use cases for which it is best to think about not having one half of the keyboard.
For example if you wanted to pan around in Figma you will need to press the space key and drag
the mouse. If you space key is on the right half of the keyboard, and you use the mouse w/ your
right hand, then this is problematic. So there are situations where you can’t assume that both
hands will be on the keyboard halves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t worry, UHK Agent makes it really easy to switch to older versions of keymaps in case something
goes horribly wrong. And you can export specific configurations as well from Agent as a JSON file.</p>
      <h3 id="hierarchy-of-needs-know-your-hands">
        
        
          Hierarchy of needs (know your hands) <a href="#hierarchy-of-needs-know-your-hands">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is understand your hands and how they move. Every time you
have to move your hands to reach for the mouse, that slows you down, probably reduces your accuracy
for a moment while you readjust your hand position, and it also will end up causing fatigue.</p>

<p>So it is really important for you to know beforehand what are the most common keys and key
combinations that you are typing in your daily workflow. This will really drive the keymaps that you
end up with. For me, it was really important to move the Backspace and Tilde keys away from the top
edges of the keyboard down to the very bottom closest to my thumbs. I also try to use 4 keys on the
bottom center of the keyboard as much as possible for commonly used things like switching
workspaces, switching focus between windows (Alt+Tab). But I have my cursor keys on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code> layer,
and I really had to practice this for many weeks before it started feeling natural.</p>

<p>When you make big changes to the way you use your keyboard, try and make one big change at a time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is incredibly demoralizing to have a keyboard that you simply can’t use. So make one big
change, like moving all the cursor keys to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod</code> layer and practice to get that to be natural,
before making some other massive change - like moving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code> key or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Backspace</code> key.</li>
  <li>So your keymaps will evolve over time and its best not to have the expectation that you will be
able to nail this on your first try.</li>
  <li>And you will end up changing keyboard shortcuts in your favorite apps (if they allow this) in
addition to the keyboard keymaps themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I broke it down into a few major categories, which are either just individual apps that I use or
just tasks that can be clumped together. And this is what I came up with (the most important stuff
is on top):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Coding
    <ul>
      <li>JetBrains IDEA based IDEs</li>
      <li>Sublime Text 3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>System level things
    <ul>
      <li>Terminal (Tilix)</li>
      <li>Albert</li>
      <li>CopyQ</li>
      <li>GNOME workspace control</li>
      <li>GNOME tiling window extension control</li>
      <li>Browsers (tab management)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>App specific
    <ul>
      <li>Figma</li>
      <li>Google Sheets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can actually put all the apps and keyboard shortcuts that you need in a spreadsheet to figure
out how to see everything in one place. Here’s an example of that.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/mechanical-keyboard-keymap-sheet.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can download this spreadsheet
<a href="/assets/mechanical-keyboard-keymaps.xlsx">here</a> as an XLSX file.</p>

          Don’t shoot self in foot <a href="#dont-shoot-self-in-foot">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Some historical context is in order. I used to code on laptops, and Kinesis keyboards on desktops,
and neither are really programmable. So in order to keep from using the cursor key cluster (Up,
Down, Left, Right) on the bottom right of the keyboard, I had developed my own crazy shortcuts in
Sublime Text and IDEA so that I would not have to move my hands when I wanted to navigate around in
code, UIs, etc.</p>

<p>Also I had to accommodate using macOS as well as Linux, and macOS is terrible about keyboard
customization (I still don’t understand how Meta, Ctrl, Alt don’t always work). This led to some
gnarly key combinations (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt + ;</code> for left, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt + '</code> for right, etc). This also required
some heavy customizations to both products, which was very time consuming and difficult to keep in
sync (between apps and across OSes).</p>

<p>After I got the UHK, I have systematically removed these “overly complex” and “custom” workarounds
and replaced them w/ the defaults, along with moving any major customizations into the UHK itself.
And I just accept that there are limits to typing using a Drop Alt keyboard or a laptop keyboard,
and don’t use them for heavy editing sessions. They are mostly for reading and research type tasks.</p>

<p>These are the insights that I gained to making this work effectively and simply using IDEA and
Sublime Text as examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t create UHK keymaps for keys that you don’t really need. Eg: there’s no need to make a keymap
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Y</code> in IDEA.</li>
  <li>Keep the keyboard shortcuts as close to the defaults as possible. Eg: there is no need to change
what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Down</code> does in either Sublime or IDEA.</li>
  <li>If not then, pick a shortcut (and add it to IDEA and Sublime) that is consistent between the two
apps. Here are some examples:
    <ol>
      <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Shift + P</code> in IDEA to open Settings (this is a Sublime shortcut that is created for
IDEA).</li>
      <li>Cloning the caret, and clone selection in both IDEA and Sublime mapped to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + J</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt + J</code> respectively.</li>
      <li>Expand selection is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + W</code> in both.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When modifying IDEA keymaps, and Sublime Text key bindings, make sure that each action works well
with other modifier keys. A great example in IDEA is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Down</code>, and its usage with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift + Alt</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these steps first, there are 2 advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The UHK mapping can be minimal, so it makes it easy to use UHK Agent to create these in the first
place, and to have multiple keymaps for various OSes (you can have a macOS specific keymap, Linux
specific one, and Windows specific one).</li>
  <li>These mappings will just work on other keyboards (eg: Drop Alt series).</li>

<p>My review of this keyboard is very short compared to the UHK v1 😀. The
<a href="https://www.mistelkeyboard.com/products/d11cf7a73da49468e2a530b4cf18e76c">Mistel BAROCCO MD770</a> has
some similarities to the UHK - it is a split ergonomic keyboard with mechanical switches. And it has
major differences - it is a 75% layout keyboard when compared to the UHK’s 60%, and it has RGB
lighting, but is is not really very configurable.</p>

<p>The build quality is excellent. I ordered one w/ the MX Brown keys, and they feel great to type on.
I think for the money this is the highest quality keyboard at its price point. Even though the
chassis is light, nothing rattles or is loose. It actually feels like a much heavier and solid
construction keyboard.</p>

<p>The connector is USB-C which is great. Just like the Drop Alt Captain, it has a convenient USB-C
port on the keyboard itself which makes it great to add another peripheral to (Bluetooth mouse
dongle) or a YubiKey.</p>

<p>The customization ability of this keyboard is extremely limited and you have to make the changes on,
and there’s no software like Agent to make this easier. You can’t change any key maps in the default
layer, but you can press a sequence of keys on the keyboard to map one key to another in four other
layers. This nothing like UHK’s Agent, or even the QMK software used by Drop Alt Captain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can download the MD770 User Manual PDF from this
<a href="https://www.mistelkeyboard.com/support">support</a> page. The PDF has information on how to program
the keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The backlight is very weak. It is just not very good. I almost wish it didn’t come with this
feature. The Drop Alt Captain wins hands down in a light show competition! However this keyboard is
roughly half the price of the Captain.</p>

<p>This is also a very short review compared to the UHK v1. The

<p>The Captain keyboard has phenomenal build quality, it weighs in at almost 3 lbs! It has amazing RGB
lighting. It looks like art more than it does a utilitarian device. The keys feel amazing to type
on.</p>

<p>The connector is USB-C which is great. And it has a convenient USB-C port on the keyboard itself
which makes it great to add another peripheral to (Bluetooth mouse dongle) or a YubiKey.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://drop.com/talk/10343/how-to-configure-your-alt-keyboard">customization</a> is limited,
since it uses the QMK software to configure keyboard shortcuts and then flash them on to the
keyboard. This software is nowhere near as easy to use as the UHK Agent. Nor is it anywhere nearly
as powerful.</p>

<p>It is not an ergonomic keyboard which for me means that I don’t really type on it for any extended
period of time. It is more of a toy or a keyboard for a machine that I might use occasionally or
even to have as a backup keyboard.</p>
