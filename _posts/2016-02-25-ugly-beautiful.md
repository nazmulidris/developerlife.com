I used to think that I had to win to get love. I had to do something for others,
in order to have value in my “self”. That is bullshit. That’s living a life to
meet other people’s expectations, and it’s all about the pursuit of perfection.
Once I let that go, I could just be … and be fearless knowing that I will never
be perfect. Now I do the things I love to do — because it’s what I love … it’s
what I was born to be. I win for me, not for anyone else. 

If you watch the first 1.35 sec of this video clip, that pretty much sums up my
life up to this moment.

The following are some big truths (for me) that I've uncovered over many years
of running painful trial and error. This may or may not be relevant to anyone
else, it totally depends on your context.

## Perfection

This is a terrible thing that disempowers us and keeps us from
achieving any of our potential, since we are never enough when we aim to be
perfect. Ideally this concept and word should be removed from our language.

## Impermanence

We are impermanent beings. We die and we change during our lives. The only thing
that’s constant in the universe is that it’s constantly deconstructing itself
and reconstructing itself. As a result, the only thing that I keep constant in
me, is that I will move forwards and adapt to change, fully acknowledging that
the results of whatever path I’m on, are unknown.

## Doing vs being 

This took me a long time to understand, because I simply didn’t have a healthy
boundary around myself of “self”. I used to think that this boundary would keep
others out. Little did I know that it actually just keeps me in, and without it,
who I am, and who the other person is, simply blurs. This is where it becomes
difficult to be aware of and voice “my” needs, since I’ve removed the structure
of “me”. Definitely not a good thing, and I don’t do this anymore. By creating
this boundary of self, it’s not that I’m any more selfless or selfish. It means
that I’m now aware of who I am in the equation of me + other person(s). Without
this self boundary, I can’t really see how I can be in any healthy
relationships.

## Fearlessness

Knowing that something will end, what do I do? Enjoy it. I tend to hold on to
places and people and moments and things, knowing (in my subconscious) that
these will end (and so will I). And I thought that I’ve found solace or security
in holding on so tightly. But all I was clinging to is my own fear. Because I
can’t control any of the things I’m holding on to. This fear then leads to
isolation, living defensively, not feeling and becoming numb, and ironically, in
the pursuit of security, and I ended up NOT living life at all. That was just a
waste — since I only have this one life to live in this moment. And every moment
is precious; and no one moment is greater or lesser than another moment. Knowing
that I will end (since we all die), what do I do? I make the experience of every
single moment a priority and I make every single moment precious. When I cry, I
cry hard. When I’m shattered, I dematerialize totally. When I fail, I fail fast.
When I win, I win big. When I heal, I heal fast. And I mostly lose and make
mistakes. Regardless, I enjoy the moment, and move on to the next one. Since
everything is impermanent — the sad moments, the happy ones, and the confusing
ones. I don’t want to have regrets. I want to keep my north star in sight at all
times, so I’m not lost — even though I don’t really know where I’m going or how
to get there (ever). For relationships, I now have the attitude that I’m not
willing to possess anyone anymore, and if they walk towards me, I will walk
towards them, and that’s the best that we can do. Since I don’t control them and
they don’t control me. This is what happens when two people are in an authentic
state with each other.

## Personal brand

In 2016, I’ve already committed to this new paradigm. I’d prototyped and
iterated it for the last 3 yrs ([since my reset](
{{'/2015/10/31/how-i-got-everything-wrong-about-everything/' | relative_url }})).
No more Plan B’s for life or anything. Only Plan A’s — when that fails, find
another Plan A. Keeps life simple — because I tend to overcomplicate things by
inappropriately thinking too much.

These are my values:

- **Be vulnerable**​ — Feeling means feeling pain and love. Can’t have one 
without
the other. And it means giving up control, and embracing the unknown.

- **​Be authentic**​ — Sync up who I am on the inside and bring that to the 
outside
in all situations.

- **Be fearless**​ — We are impermanent, enjoy it, and be in the moment — we 
have
nothing to lose except the full experience of this life itself. This releases me
to start things without being great. Because to be great, one must first start.

## Ugly Beautiful

Life is messy. Death is messy. Love is messy. Startups are messy. Racing is
messy. Winning is messy. Losing is messy. Pain is messy. Healing is messy.
Everything is imperfect. And many things are ugly. And many things are
beautiful. We are all where we are on our journey, and we are the only ones who
are responsible for our evolution and setting our “north stars”.
