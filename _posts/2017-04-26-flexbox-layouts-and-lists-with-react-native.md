## Introduction

This tutorial is all about using Flexbox layout in React Native. I will show you an in-depth example
of taking a wireframe and extracting it into a set of React Native components and then styling them
with Flexbox so that they match what was designed in the wireframe (in Sketch). I will also be
covering the new
[FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/flatlist.html) in React
Native, which is the
[preferred way to create lists](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html).

I wonâ€™t be covering React Native basics, for that please refer to my
[Getting Started with React Native tutorial](https://developerlife.com/2017/03/31/getting-started-with-react-native/).

## What you will learn in this tutorial

You can learn more about the basics of Flexbox in
[this tutorial](http://developerlife.com/2017/03/31/getting-started-with-react-native/), and
[here on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).
In this tutorial, I will take you thru the process of dissecting a wireframe and turning into React
Native components, and using styling to make the UI match the high fidelity mockups you might get
from your design team.

I will also walk you thru the new FlatList component that is part of React Native. It's a very
powerful API and it's very elegant and simple to use, yet, it's very expressive and powerful -
what's not to like!

## Get the project from GitHub

We are going to use this fake weather app that I've created, along with the help of
[Maret Eiland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mareteiland/) - she's a designer who can talk to
developers :). You can download the source code and run the project on your local development
environment.

- Here's the
  [link to the project on GitHub](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/tree/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271).
- You can download the
  [Sketch wireframes here](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/tree/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/design).

Here is a video of what the app looks like on Android:

## Wireframe -> Flexbox layout -> code

Before we get started on the process, here are the 3 main screens of the weather app that we are
using. You can find these screens in this
[Sketch file here](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/tree/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/design).

![]({{ 'assets/flexbox-layout-1.png' | relative_url }})

Each screen of this app contains a FlatList with a row renderer and some styling. I will take you
thru the process of generating the first screen that shows a list of places with the current
temperature and current conditions icon. Once you see how the first screen is created, the other two
screens are very simple to create.

### Going from wireframe to Flexbox

The wireframes from Sketch contain a picture of the desired UI. This is what your design team might
hand you. The task of converting this picture into React components with styling is our challenge.
The best way to think about this is to:

- Start cutting your wireframe into boxes that map to React components.

- Think about how these components are composed. They are probably going to be nested somehow. There
  are going to be parent components (containers) which will contain children components. These
  children might also be containers for other components in this hierarchy.

Let's use a real example of the Home screen of our app. It has a header (icon and Weather app) that
is provided by the Stack Navigator. So we can ignore this. We are most interested in the list view
that contains places and current temperature information. This list view is going to be built using
a FlatList, since this is the new and better way of doing things.

The way FlatList works is that it takes some data, and it takes a row renderer which will handle the
task of rendering or painting each row to the screen. FlatList also takes care of it's own
scrolling, and you can even set the layout direction (horizontal or vertical). Additionally,
`flex:1` is set on the FlatList by default and you can't really change that.

### Going from FlexBox to code

If you look at the diagram below, it visually depicts how we break the Home screen into a FlatList,
then apply styling to the FlatList and then map that into React components that we add to our JSX.

![]({{'assets/flexbox-layout-2.png' | relative_url}})

This is the code for the JSX you see on the right of the image:

```html
<View style="{css.home_screen.v_container}">
  <StatusBar />

  <FlatList
    style="{css.home_screen_list.container}"
    data="{listData}"
    renderItem="{this.renderRow}"
  />
</View>
```

#### Here are more details on the styling ([from Styles.js](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/Styles.js)):

There's a `v_container` style that's set for a View, which acts as the main container for the entire
screen. It sets the background color to a light gray color and sets up the flex box container and
main axis and cross axis alignment options.

```javascript
export const home_screen = StyleSheet.create({
  v_container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 8,
    flexDirection: "column", // main axis
    justifyContent: "center", // main axis
    alignItems: "center", // cross axis
    backgroundColor: colors.background_dark,
  },
})
```

#### Here are more details on the JSX ([from HomeScreen.js](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/HomeScreen.js)):

Inside of the View we have a `StatusBar` component for Android (ignore this for now). The main thing
inside of this View is the `FlatList` component. This component is created with:

- The dummy data (more in this later in this tutorial).
- The style for the `FlatList` itself.
- The `renderItem` function that will be used to render each row of the data.

Here's the styling for the FlatList:

```css
container: {
  marginTop: 14,
  alignSelf: "stretch",
}
```

#### The `renderRow` function

The heavy lifting of doing React component composition with Flexbox really happens in the
`renderRow` function which we will deep dive into now.

```html
renderRow({item}) { const time = `${item.time}`; const place = `${item.place}`; const temp =
css.addDegreesToEnd(item.currentTemp); const {iconName, iconFont, iconColor} = item.icon; let
actualRowComponent =
<View style="{css.home_screen_list.row}">
  <View style="{css.home_screen_list.row_cell_timeplace}">
    <Text style="{css.home_screen_list.row_time}">{time}</Text>
    <Text style="{css.home_screen_list.row_place}">{place}</Text>
  </View>
  <Icon
    color="{iconColor}"
    size="{css.values.small_icon_size}"
    name="{iconName}"
    type="{iconFont}"
  />
  <Text style="{css.home_screen_list.row_cell_temp}">{temp}</Text> </View
>; ... }
```

Here's the styling code that goes along with this code.

```javascript
export const home_screen_list = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    marginTop: 14,
    alignSelf: "stretch",
  },
  row: {
    elevation: 1,
    borderRadius: 2,
    backgroundColor: colors.tertiary,
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: "row", // main axis
    justifyContent: "flex-start", // main axis
    alignItems: "center", // cross axis
    paddingTop: 10,
    paddingBottom: 10,
    paddingLeft: 18,
    paddingRight: 16,
    marginLeft: 14,
    marginRight: 14,
    marginTop: 0,
    marginBottom: 6,
  },
  row_cell_timeplace: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: "column",
  },
  row_cell_temp: {
    color: colors.weather_text_color,
    paddingLeft: 16,
    flex: 0,
    fontSize: values.font_temp_size,
    fontFamily: values.font_body,
  },
  row_time: {
    color: colors.weather_text_color,
    textAlignVertical: "bottom",
    includeFontPadding: false,
    flex: 0,
    fontSize: values.font_time_size,
    fontFamily: values.font_body,
  },
  row_place: {
    color: colors.weather_text_color,
    textAlignVertical: "top",
    includeFontPadding: false,
    flex: 0,
    fontSize: values.font_place_size,
    fontFamily: values.font_body,
  },
})
```

The following diagram shows what is happening in this `renderRow` function.

![]({{'assets/flexbox-layout-3.png' | relative_url}})

Here are the steps that have to happen going from the picture of a row in the wireframe (on the
left) to the code on the right:

- Each row of the `FlatList` is comprised of some data that has to be displayed. We extract this
  data from the `{item}` JSON object that's passed to the `renderRow` function from the `FlatList`.
  From this `{item}` object, we get the `time`, `place`, `currentTemperature`, and `icon`. The
  values from these objects are then used in the React components nested in the JSX code.

- There's a container View that is styled with the `home_screen_list.row` style. This basically
  creates a horizontal container which will hold all the other components inside of it. There are 3
  React components that are nested inside of this container:

  - `View` that holds the 2 `Text` components that display the time and place info, that are stacked
    vertically. The `home_screen_list_row_cell_timeplace` sets this container up. `flex:1` is set on
    this container, and it takes up all the horizontal space that's available, so that the icon and
    temperature `Text` components can be slammed to the right of the row. This creates the space
    that you see in the UI. ![]({{'assets/flexbox-layout-4.png' | relative_url}})

  - `Icon` that displays the font icon. No `flex` value is set for this component, so it takes up
    its preferred height and width.

  - `Text` that displays the temperature value with styling `home_screen_list.row_cell_temp`.
    `flex:0` value is set for this component, so it takes up its preferred height and width.

- The `FlatList` them stamps out each row of the data that's provided to it, and renders the UI that
  you see in the app for `HomeScreen.js`.

- In the code, there's some platform specific code that uses a `TouchableHighlight` on iOS or
  `TouchableNativeFeedback` on Android to wrap each list row. When a user touches each list row, it
  uses the `_navigation` object in order to push the appropriate route into the
  [Navigator](http://developerlife.com/2017/04/15/navigation-and-styling-with-react-native/).

### Best practices for collaborating with your design team

Whew! That has been a deep dive into how to go from wireframes -> flexbox -> code in React Native.
You can engage your design team in this process as well, since they can provide you with:

1. Feedback on how to actually create the styles (what values to set for padding, margin, size of
   the icons, colors, and so forth).

2. Organize the layouts in your code using Flexbox. Since they constructed the wireframes, they have
   a vision in their minds of how the UI should actually function. Currently they give developers a
   picture of a thing, and not the actual thing. Developers are then responsible for taking the
   picture and making the thing. And lots falls apart in this collaboration today.

It is also important for your design team to understand the basics of Flexbox so that they can
understand how to structure their thinking when assembling the wireframes themselves. All too often,
designs get 'shipped' from design to development and there isn't a good way for designers to
communicate with developers, so that their designs can come to life in the way that was intended by
them.

## Data driven design

Our fake weather app is fake because it actually doesn't hook into a live data source for it's
information. However, the app is constructed in a way that it should be possible to swap out this
fake data pipeline for a real one (that's coming from a web service). I'm going to release a
tutorial very soon with this app using real weather data,
[Firebase](https://developerlife.com/category/firebase), and even social SignIn, so please stay
tuned for that.

The fake data in our app comes from
[`Data.js`](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/Data.js).
This is a JSON object that holds an array of objects for the `FlatList` component. Each item in this
array is an object that holds information about a place:

- place name,
- time,
- icon,
- current temperature,
- description,
- an array of objects holding today's forecast (called `dailyForecast`),
- an array of objects holding this week's forecast (called `weeklyForecast`).

I showed you in depth how the `HomeScreen.js` is built, and how it leverages a `FlatList` to render
this list of data. When the user clicks on a row in the list, React Navigation is used
([Router.js](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/Router.js))
in order to push the user selection of place, and then provide views that
[display today's forecast](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/DetailsScreen1.js),
and the
[week's forecast](https://github.com/r3bl-alliance/react-native-weather/blob/531f25099536e1337d0267029eb8975d66288271/app/DetailsScreen2.js).

Working with data in this manner to prototype the app's UI and interaction is really good practice,
and I recommend it strongly. I even recommend that you engage with your designers and get them to
start with data as well, and consult with development teams to determine if certain types of data
can be accessed by your app.
