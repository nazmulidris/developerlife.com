## My story
I've brought products to life from a glimmer of a vision to a team building it, 
to having customers, and eventually seeing the product come to an end. I've 
worked as part of large and small teams and led them to make impossible things 
possible.

I have over 20 years of leadership, software engineering, design, and product 
management experience. As a multifaceted engineer, designer, and communicator, 
I’ve focused on creating, designing, building, and collaborating with people to 
bring amazing user experiences to life across multiple platforms.

I've led the creation of developer narratives and scaled them out at Google, 
eg: I created the first design workshops for developers at IO13 & IO14. I've 
founded and presented at the Design for Humans (in real life) meetup. I've 
created the UX Design for Mobile class on Udacity, and my own UX Design show on 
YouTube both for Google. I also run and create content for a very prominent 
developer tutorial site called developerlife.com (which was established in 
1998).

## Leadership and Resourcefulness
  * Was founder and CEO of TRNQL Inc, a startup to build SDKs for iOS and 
Android in 2014
  * Raised $1.5M of VC funding
  * Recruited and managed team of 6 people
  * Created and shipped SDKs that collects valuable signals from Android and 
iOS devices that fed ML to better understand human behavior
  * Founded R3BL startup that is an incubator for apps and services that 
address human needs.

## Communication
  * Created developerlife.com tutorials on Android, React, Redux, and React 
Native, that has been around since ‘98 and has over 10M pageviews.
  * Created & ran UX Design experiential workshops for developers at Google 
IO13 and IO14 hosting over 2k attendees – 
[bit.ly/2o3oAni](http://bit.ly/2o3oAni).
  * Founded and grew Design for Humans meetup group to 2k members for UX 
design. I’ve presented at over 34 meetups, and over 4k developer & designer 
attendees – [bit.ly/uxdmeetup](http://bit.ly/uxdmeetup).

## Product Design
  * UX Design for Developers YouTube show for Google Android with over 200k 
views [bit.ly/uxdplaylist](http://bit.ly/uxdplaylist)
  * Udacity class on UX Design for Mobile reaching over 200k people online 
[bit.ly/uxdclass](http://bit.ly/uxdclass)
  * G+ UX design community 8k designers & developers

## Software Engineering

### Technologies

  * Full stack developer with experience in cloud, mobile, and web 
technologies, such as Java, Kotlin, Android, JavaScript, React Native, React, 
Redux, Firebase, NoSQL databases, CMS systems, payments & licensing & 
subscriptions systems, enterprise backend systems (ETL, Data transformations, 
app servers, etc).

### Mobile app development toolkits & infrastructure

  * Created Android app development container and SDK (built on top of Android 
framework to expose contextual awareness to any app for TRNQL)
  * Created BlackBerry app development container (with custom UI toolkits, 
animation libraries, networking, and app lifecycle management).
  * Created Java desktop app development containers (with custom UI toolkits, 
animation libraries, networking, and app lifecycle management) for Rich 
Internet Applications.

### Cloud Infrastructure
  * I created a cross platform PaaS service in Java, built on top of Tomcat, 
similar to Google App Engine that powered all the BlackBerry apps (from 2006 to 
2011) and then became the server backend for TRNQL SDK offering (from 
2015-2016).
  * Created DSLs to declaratively generate persistence, networking, data 
models, and data binding. Created source code generators to take DSLs and 
generate code in Java for server, Android, and BlackBerry, and even JavaScript 
for web.
  * This server supported web, iOS, Android, BlackBerry clients.
  * It also supported payments integration and issuing app licenses and 
managing app subscriptions.

### Cross platform development toolkits & infrastructure
  * Created Web app development containers to integrate seamlessly with cloud 
infrastructure and a multitude of mobile clients (Android, BlackBerry, iOS) 
from 2009 to 2011.

### Android apps
  * I published 2 Android apps to the Play Store.
  * ExtraTKT in 2009.
  * TRNQL interplay in 2015.

### BlackBerry Apps
  * I was a finalist twice in the Global BlackBerry DevCon 2009 and 2010 for 
best app in the world (Wicked blogging app, and RainOrShine weather app).
  * I published 4 apps that were used by 100's of thousands of users globally 
from 2006 to 2011
  * Wicked blogging app for BlackBerry
  * MyListy list app for BlackBerry and Web
  * DulyNoted note taking app for BlackBerry and Web
  * RainOrShine weather app for BlackBerry (was top 5 weather apps in 
BlackBerry App World for a while) and was featured in the App World.

### Middleware infrastructure for mobile
  * Created underlying technology to enable servers to integrate with multiple 
client platforms using low level sockets communications, custom binary data 
transmission protocols, complete custom app servers, and even custom mobile app 
UI markup languages from 1999 to 2004.
  * Created high performance application data network infrastructure to deliver 
push updates from server to client, and a whole host of other innovations (see 
patent).

## Patents and books
  * Patent on mobile computing 
[google.com/patents/US6891860](http://google.com/patents/US6891860)
  * Book on Java and XML [a.co/friJT12](http://a.co/friJT12)

## About developerlife.com
I started developerlife.com in Nov 1998 when I couldn’t find a decent tutorial 
on XML and Java to build web based apps, so I decided to write one myself, and 
this site was born. It served up its [first tutorial on on 31 Dec 
1998](http://xml.coverpages.org/idris199901.html). Like [Alan 
Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) said: “The best way to predict the 
future is to invent it”.

It grew to become a trusted resource to professional programmers, college 
students, universities, research institutions, [standards 
bodies](http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlFAQ15.html#JAVA-GEN), online magazines, 
and even enterprise software vendors.

Since then technologies have come and gone, and I have created tutorials on 
many varied topics. The goal of the content is in service of the creation of 
technology that adapts to the needs of humans.

You can see how this site has evolved since the beginning in the [Internet 
Archive Wayback Machine](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/developerlife.com).
