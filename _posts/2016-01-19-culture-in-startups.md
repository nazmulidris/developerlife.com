I‚Äôm a first time CEO and I‚Äôm documenting things that I‚Äôm learning on my journey
of creating and running my startup. In this article, I‚Äôm going to cover a lot of
ground related to culture‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the inner work it takes to run a startup.
Culture has a deep impact on experience of running a startup and being a part of
it. If this interests you, read on.

## Is it important?

A lot of people might question whether it‚Äôs even important to have a focus on
culture at an early stage startup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere are so many things that have to be
done, like raising capital, getting the product built, finding and supporting
customers, hiring the right team, and on and on‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the runway is finite! How
important is it to get this ‚Äòculture‚Äô thing right? Is it a froofy thing? Should
people just work until they drop, for the promise of success one day?

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the idea of creating work spaces where special
people can do special work. And I‚Äôve recently had the opportunity of exploring a
lot of different paths‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprototyping, iterating, and learning from failure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto
figure out what works and doesn‚Äôt work for me.

I just started my first company in Apr 2015, which has been my dream for as long
as I can remember. I‚Äôd started a few companies before this, but not in Silicon
Valley, they were self funded (which led to it‚Äôs own misadventures). trnql
(pronounced tranquil) is a VC funded company in Palo Alto. Prior to starting
this company, I spent a few years working for Google, which gave me such a
different perspective about how to run companies than anything that I‚Äôd been
used to prior to that.

## Personal growth / inner work

The biggest challenge that I‚Äôve faced while starting this company is personal
growth. This has impacted the culture more than anything; culture has just been
a reflection of this to a large degree. It‚Äôs been about really coming to terms
[with who I am]({{'/2015/10/31/how-i-got-everything-wrong-about-everything/' |
relative_url }}). And who I want to be. And what choices do I make on a daily
basis. And to own these choices, and be clear about them with everyone else
around me.

For the longest time I was an overachiever who channelled his inner fear and
insecurity of not being good enough into a very social acceptable (‚Äúproductive‚Äù)
outlets, and worked very hard. I just worked all the time. Whatever project I
was working on, I would internalize it completely, and give it my all. I didn‚Äôt
really spend much time being in the moment with anything or anyone, especially
myself. And this type of behavior was applauded by society. It was all about
achieving outcomes, without realizing that experience of the outcome is but a
moment, and living in this way sacrifices all the moments that lead up to the
outcome, and extend past the outcome. By missing all these moments by fixating
on the outcome, life doesn‚Äôt hold much peace or happiness.

This bias towards burnout came to an end before I started my company. I actually
ended up taking some time off from Google. I forced myself to do no work for 4
months that I took off, after I had launched design workshops at [Google 
IO14](https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/e82578c9-22db-e311-b297-00155d5066d7) & a
[Udacity class on Mobile UX design](http://bit.ly/uxdclass).

It was one of the most difficult things that I‚Äôve ever done. To wake up every
day and just do nothing that is related to work. Go on a walk, think, spend time
with people, do yoga, drive at the track, invest time in relationships with
other people, and be myself (what is that?) Anything except for working. So this
was a bit extreme, but I had been stuck in the overwork and burnout cycle for so
long, that I needed some harsh medicine to restore balance.

I had deluded myself into thinking that I was a ‚Äúhuman doing‚Äù. This pause helped
me hit the brakes on this and start switching to becoming a **‚Äúhuman being‚Äù**.
What does it mean to be a human being? To try and live every moment in a way
that is true to self; doing things that resonate with self. To do what you love,
and to love what you do. To be authentic and truthful and see yourself for all
that you are (the light and the dark) and accept it; and don‚Äôt hide from
yourself or anyone else. And just let go of the outcomes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey don‚Äôt help the
experience of this moment. In fact, they are detrimental, because the attention
we give them, takes away from this moment (which is all we have) and actually
gets us farther away (ironically) from achieving that outcome.

A lot can be gleaned from what I named my company. `trnql`‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätranquil‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor peace
üòÄ. There was nothing peaceful about my existence prior to taking these 4 months
off and just settling. What followed was a period of tremendous inner change and
radical shifts to the middle (for about 12 months). I have been working on
restoring balance in everything that has been my life, and trnql and its culture
are merely a reflection of what has been happening on the inside for me.

## Values

It‚Äôs really important to have a clear vision of what culture should be at the
early stage of a company. Who you are, how you show up, what you believe in are
the fabric of this culture. It‚Äôs important to have the confidence to fight for
this vision as more people join the company, and use this vision as a way to
find the right mix of people who will make the collective greater than the sum
of its individual parts. For me this meant the following things:

1. believe in what I do, and find others who believe in it as well,
1. focusing on building a healthy relationship with self and others,
1. allowing myself and others breathing room to run experiments and fail‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääie, 
play,
1. stop focusing on the outcome‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälet go of the ‚Äòexit‚Äô, let go of whatever
external validation or status I was seeking; basically let go of ego, control,
and righteousness (the belief that the world owes me anything).

## Preventing burnout

In my mind, failure and learning are synonymous (if you‚Äôre doing it right). Just
like wisdom and pain :). Startups are risky. That is by definition. We don‚Äôt
exactly know how the unknown is going to present itself. So, to bring more fear
and insecurity (which feeds ego, and this idea that we have control) into this
situation is just very dangerous. There is too much fuel there already for an
explosive mixture. I believe in what I do. And I want to work with other people
who believe as well. That was one of the most important elements to get right at
trnql, to ensure that the right mix of people are joining the company.

I also found people who are very hard working and dedicated naturally. The key
with motivated people like this is to ensure that they don‚Äôt burn out! Our
culture really encourages this idea that people should just work themselves to
the ground for short term productivity gains. So many studies have shown that
you can operate in this way for about 2 weeks and then productivity just starts
to plummet, and the harder you push, it just keeps going down. This is a not a
good way to live and is not a good relationship to have with oneself, or with
anyone else. And how do I keep burnout away? Make sure that people have space to
breathe and not become overly fixated with deadlines and specific outcomes,
which leads me to the next point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplay.

## Play vs Depression

At the start of the company, I was pushing hard as usual and trying to get
things done, and everything was a mad dash to the finish. This is how things
operated for about 4 months, and it was awful.

This wasn‚Äôt the way in which I had envisioned running my company, and this isn‚Äôt
how I wanted to live my life either. So I really had to find the strength to
fight for what I truly believe in. And I changed things. And made it so that
everyone at the company knows that they are empowered to run experiments on
their own or as a team, to bring in different perspectives and insights that
would have been lost otherwise.

We also know that there is no punishment for the failure of these small
experiments‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly things we learn from and iterate on to make things better.
Aka, play.

By play, I don‚Äôt mean having foosball tables, and playing ping pong. I mean that
people are empowered to bring their ideas to life in a way that they see fit,
once we have talked about the parameters of the experiment they are running,
what the scope is, timeline is, and what results we may or may not expect.

Honestly, we are just being realistic about how venturing out into the unknown
works anyway. We don‚Äôt know how a piece of technology is going to work out
exactly‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot until we try and tune and tweak it.

This culture of play has really unlocked so much innovation at trnql. Eg: we
discovered that we should invest in this online challenge to find interesting
developers who can discover our technology and make great apps for end users.
Eg: we tried different things at our meetups and realized that some formats
didn‚Äôt work at all, which was a great gift, because we tuned our formula so that
we know how to reach what audience and for what goal. And it turned out at the
end the answer was for trnql not be involved in these meetups at all!

These are things that are impossible to learn without trying experiments and
learning from their failures. Success often isn‚Äôt a good teacher, but failure
can be, if you know how to handle it üòÄ.

## Focus vs distraction

Another element of effective play is to kill distractions! When folks are
fixated on outcomes rather than the journey, they tend to optimize for local
maxima, and just make really short sighted decisions. Removing these outcomes
from the mind releases it, and allows it to be more creative, focused,
effective, and more efficient.

The creative process isn‚Äôt driven by outcomes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs driven when it‚Äôs nurtured
and given some space. By clearing things that hinder the journey, which includes
this outcome-driven mentality, distractions are also cleared. And we can focus
on what is truly important in the moment. And the next moment. And so on.

We are optimizing the process for maximizing the moment, rather than sacrificing
the moment for some outcome (that won‚Äôt be achieved on this path anyway).

Another aspect of removing distraction is having a clear vision of what you do
want. This doesn‚Äôt have to be crystal clear, but there has to be enough there,
such that this vision doesn‚Äôt look like everything and the kitchen sink thrown
in there. There‚Äôs a lot of discipline and pruning and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù that goes into
crafting this clear vision, and communicating it to everyone; along with saying
‚Äúno‚Äù to all the needless distractions.

For trnql, I have a clear vision of what I want to do, and how I want to do it
(without really thinking about an outcome like an exit)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich might not be the
case with other companies. I have a unique background because of my
skillset‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcoding, advocacy, sales/marketing, etc. which has allowed me to
remove distractions, and also look at the high level and low level at the same
time; my team is benefiting from past work and experience.

## Empowering people

When you give people the space to play and a clear idea of what is expected of
them, and the leeway they have to fail, and what scope of things they are
allowed to try, then you have effectively empowered them! By rewarding the
willingness to fail, to learn from failure, and to try again, by being an
example that they can follow, you can cultivate empowerment in the team. This is
what leads to great process efficiency, since so much needless communication and
collaboration is cut out. When people are empowered and they take on the role as
an owner or leader, then they are able to do so much more in their role, than
they would if they didn‚Äôt have this feeling of empowerment.

This is difficult for some founders or micromanaging CEOs to do. A lot folks
want to retain control (since this is tied to their ego), and this is not really
empowering for the team. By giving up direct control, but retaining diffuse
control, and being clear with expectations and the vision, it allows the right
mix of chaos and planning to maximize creativity and efficacy of execution. It‚Äôs
a delicate balance and I can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs a fixed formula for this. Depends on
you, on your team, on your product, etc.

## Mistakes made and lessons learned

I made a lot of mistakes with hiring early on. I worked with friends and family
and all this ended badly (as it was difficult to set clear boundaries and
expectations with them). I had to let people go, which was painful, but I
learned quickly the importance of getting the right people. Not people who are
spectacular individual contributors. But people who are willing to work with the
team, willing to grow, and also very good at what they do‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut are willing to
learn. This is counterintuitive at times, since it‚Äôs easy to think that simply
adding more spectacular individual contributors will get you there. Nope. Less
than spectacular contributors that work well as a team, under good leadership,
will get you there much more quickly & smoothly than you ever thought was
possible.

## Full circle

So the culture at trnql paid huge dividends in the last few quarters with our
big push to get both Android and iOS SDKs out of beta and into general
availability! We worked really hard for 9 straight weeks. No one got sick. No
one took a hit on their relationships. No one lost a weekend. No one had a
sleepless night (not due to work anyway). And we ended up doing the smoothest
product launches that I‚Äôve ever experienced in my career!

And all of this was from a commitment to play‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto not freaking out when
something didn‚Äôt go according to plan, and having the patience and resilience to
pivot and come up with something different (and sometimes even better) that what
we had originally envisioned.

It‚Äôs about finding this delicate balance between exerting one‚Äôs will, but
keeping ego out of it, so that we can bend with what the universe puts in our
path.

## Human being and not doing

And this all comes back to me. The company‚Äôs culture is a reflection of who I
am. If I want to see something in my culture then I have to do the inner work to
make it happen in myself.

My team of 5 looks to me for direction, and mimics my behavior. When I endorse
something and encourage it by doing it, and leading with my example, then it
becomes part of what everyone does.

Eg: we had gone back and forth on adopting slack for months. Then I saw the CEO
of slack speak at a VC event that trnql‚Äôs investors held (we have the same
investors as slack), and I loved the story of slack. Later on that week we were
using slack, because I set the example that we get off of Google Hangouts and
move to Slack, and favor it over IM and email! And it took about 24 hours for
everyone to get on board (the advantage of a small team).

Along the way, I‚Äôve been pushing boundaries and getting out of my comfort zone:

- I‚Äôve taken up dance as a way to understand how to embody mindful movement and
communicate with people without using words.

- I drive at the race track as meditation, to understand that everything changes
all the time and the way is to adapt and leverage in order to build forward
momentum; and not to let some bad moments stall the momentum or break the
rhythm/flow.

- I practice Yoga and Chinese Internal Martial Arts (TaiChi, HsingI, Pagua) and
healing arts, as a way to make sure that my body is healthy, and that my mind
and my body are in sync.

- I focus on being a more sociable person, and am focused on people. I used to
think I was a technologist. Now I think of myself as a humanist. It‚Äôs all about
nurturing the right relationships, and showing up as your authentic self (which
isn‚Äôt easy and takes courage). To this end, I‚Äôve even started a group of like
minded people who are looking for community and deep connection in Silicon
Valley called SV life hackers. It‚Äôs an in person group where we can share
lifehacks and other wisdom that we have gained by experimentation and experience
that can benefit others in concrete things in their current lives.

- I make sure to create space in my life, by not being overwhelmed with work and
become overworked and burnt out. And this is a daily practice, and while it gets
easier as new habits are formed, there are always challenges, and new twists and
turns that show up on the journey. But if you can fixate on enjoying the journey
instead of constantly thinking about when you are going to get there, then play
and building relationships, then investing in self and others will naturally
come into focus and become a healthy way of being. It‚Äôs easy to get distracted
by the big payoff, and just burn everything to get there. But there is more than
one payoff in life . There are a string of payoffs, and unless we look at life
as a string of small to large payoffs, instead of a bunch of emptiness until we
get to one big payoff, then imbalance and burnout are going to result.

## What‚Äôs next

I know many challenges lie ahead. I have many tools to tackle these challenges.
I have a great team. I have great friends and family that can help me be the
best version of me. I‚Äôm investing in myself and treating myself in the way that
I want to treat others‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith acceptance and love. It all starts with self. If
you feed the beautiful parts of yourself, rather than putting all your attention
on the ugly bits, then you will become the best version of you. It‚Äôs the
universal law of attraction‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhatever you put your attention to, will be drawn
to you, and you to it.

I will write more posts on this topic. And document the journey I‚Äôm going thru
at trnql as a young CEO.

Don‚Äôt stop believing. And hold on to that feeling.
