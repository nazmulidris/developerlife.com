## My story

I am equal parts: engineer, management, and product person; both hands-on and in leadership. I move
fluidly between the realms of desktop, web, mobile, cloud, infrastructure, server, client.

I've brought products to life from a glimmer of a vision to a team building it, to having customers,
and eventually seeing the product come to an end. I've worked as part of large and small teams and
led them to make impossible things possible.

I have over 30 years of work experience in the tech sector:

- 22 years in software engineering.
- 8 years in executive leadership, design, product management experience.

As a multifaceted entrepreneur, leader, engineer, designer, and communicator, I've focused on
creating, designing, building, and collaborating with people to bring amazing user experiences to
life across multiple platforms.

## What I'm Building Now

I'm a **Rustacean Systems Engineering Leader** building high-performance infrastructure and leading
teams that ship production systems.

### r3bl â€” Production TUI/CLI Infrastructure

I'm the founder and principal engineer of
[r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core), a Rust framework
for building terminal user interfaces and command-line developer tools.

- **2M+ downloads** on crates.io over 2 years
- Focus on performance, memory efficiency, and developer ergonomics
- Used in production for developer tools, infrastructure, and monitoring
- **Technologies:** Rust (async/tokio, type-state patterns, concurrent programming), systems
  programming, performance optimization

**Why it matters:** I'm solving real problems for developers building complex terminal and CLI
applications. The r3bl framework represents years of experience in systems programming, performance
optimization, and production-grade infrastructure design.

## What I Bring

### Engineering (22 years)

- **Currently:** 4 years daily Rust systems programming, building r3bl-org
- **Google:** Android Studio IDE platform team â€” Performance, stability, and response time
  optimization for IntelliJ-based IDE serving millions of developers
- **Founder & CEO, TRNQL (2015):** Raised $1.5M, built and shipped production Android/iOS SDKs, led
  distributed engineering teams
- **Full-stack systems:** Desktop, web, mobile, cloud infrastructure â€” TypeScript, React, Node.js,
  Kotlin, Java, extensive backend and infrastructure experience

### Leadership (8 years)

- Executive leadership combining technical depth with business strategy
- Team building, product vision, and go-to-market execution
- Comfortable moving between architecture, code, and organizational leadership

## Teaching & Community

I share production engineering lessons through:

- **YouTube:** [Advanced Rust systems programming](https://www.youtube.com/@developerlifecom) â€”
  async, tokio, design patterns, parsing, concurrency
- **Articles:** [developerlife.com/category/rust](https://developerlife.com/category/Rust/) â€”
  Architecture patterns, real-world case studies
- **Since 1998:** Writing about software engineering at developerlife.com (10M+ pageviews)

> âœ¨ You can read all my articles on [developerlife.com](https://developerlife.com) and watch my
> videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@developerlifecom).

## Leadership and Resourcefulness

- Was founder and CEO of TRNQL Inc, a startup to build SDKs for iOS and Android in 2014

- Raised \$1.5M of VC funding

- Recruited and managed team of 6 people

- Created and shipped SDKs that collects valuable signals from Android and iOS devices that fed ML
  to better understand human behavior

## Software Engineering

### Technologies

- Experienced in building mobile apps and SDKs, web apps and APIs, IDEs, and web services

- Well versed in Rust, Kotlin, Java, Android, Test driven development, TypeScript, Node.js,
  JavaScript, Jest, React, Redux, Python, React Native, Firebase, databases (SQL & NoSQL), CLI
  apps, GUI desktop apps

### Mobile app development toolkits & infrastructure

- Created Android app development container and SDK (built on top of Android framework to expose
  contextual awareness to any app for TRNQL)

- Created BlackBerry app development container (with custom UI toolkits, animation libraries,
  networking, and app lifecycle management)

- Created Java desktop app development containers (with custom UI toolkits, animation libraries,
  networking, and app lifecycle management) for Rich Internet Applications

### Cloud Infrastructure

- Created a cross platform PaaS service in Java, built on top of Tomcat, similar to Google App
  Engine that powered ScreamingToaster BlackBerry apps from 2006 to 2011, and then became the server
  backend for TRNQL SDK offering (from 2015-2016)

- Created DSLs to declaratively generate persistence, networking, data models, and data binding.
  Created source code generators to take DSLs and generate code in Java for server, Android, and
  BlackBerry, and even JavaScript for web

- This server supported web, iOS, Android, BlackBerry clients

- It also supported payments integration and issuing app licenses and managing app subscriptions

### Cross platform development toolkits & infrastructure

- Created Web app development containers to integrate seamlessly with cloud infrastructure and a
  multitude of mobile clients (Android, BlackBerry, iOS) from 2009 to 2011

### Android apps

Apps I've published to the Play Store:

- ExtraTKT in 2009
- [TRNQL interplay in 2015](https://apkpure.com/trnql-interplay/com.trnql.sample_interplay)
- [StayAwake in 2017](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.r3bl.stayawake&hl=en_US)

### BlackBerry Apps

- I was a finalist **twice** in the Global BlackBerry Developer Conference in 2009 and 2010 for best
  app in the world (Wicked blogging app, and RainOrShine weather app)

- I published 4 apps that were used by 100's of thousands of users globally from 2006 to 2011

  - Wicked blogging app for BlackBerry
  - MyListy list app for BlackBerry and Web
  - DulyNoted note taking app for BlackBerry and Web
  - RainOrShine weather app for BlackBerry (was top 5 weather apps in BlackBerry App World for a
    while) and was featured in the App World

### Middleware infrastructure for mobile

- Created underlying technology to enable servers to integrate with multiple client platforms using
  low level sockets communications, custom binary data transmission protocols, complete custom app
  servers, and even custom mobile app UI markup languages from 1999 to 2004

- Created high performance application data network infrastructure to deliver push updates from
  server to client, and a whole host of other innovations (see patent)

## Communication

I've led the creation of developer narratives and scaled them out at Google, eg: I created the first
design workshops for developers at IO13 & IO14. I've founded and presented at the Design for Humans
(in real life) meetup. I've created the UX Design for Mobile class on Udacity, and my own UX Design
show on YouTube both for Google. I also run and create content for a very prominent developer
tutorial site called [developerlife.com](http://developerlife.com) (which was established in 1998).

- Created developerlife.com tutorials on Android, Kotlin, React, Redux, and React Native, that has
  been around since â€˜98 and has over 10M pageviews

- Create developerlife.com YouTube channel with ~1K subscribers and many videos, covering Rust live
  coding covers advanced topics on systems programming and Rust advanced concepts, like async,
  tokio, design patterns (type state, newtype, etc), concurrent and parallel programming, parsing,
  code generation, and more:
  [youtube.com/@developerlifecom](https://www.youtube.com/@developerlifecom)

- Created & ran UX Design experiential workshops for developers at Google IO13 and IO14 hosting over
  2k attendees â€“ [bit.ly/2o3oAni](http://bit.ly/2o3oAni)

- Founded and grew Design for Humans meetup group to 2k members for UX design. Iâ€™ve presented at
  over 34 meetups, and over 4k developer & designer attendees â€“
