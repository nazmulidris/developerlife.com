      "excerpt" : "Overall, the API is pretty straightforward to use, assuming that you arefamiliar with asynchronous processing in the first place. However, if you are notfamiliar with asynchronous processing, then this business of callbacks can be quiteconfusing and daunting. Additionally Tomcat 7 and Servlet API 3.0 make it easierto configure servlets using annotations. There are other cool features in 3.0 thatI haven’t covered in this tutorial, like loading servlets programmatically."

A common mistake that is made is long running tasks are performed in thisEDT/main thread, and this leads to lots of application failures."

The basics covered here affect layout transitions, and animationof a View itself, using tweening animation, which includes each of the followingeffects (or any combination) - Alpha, Rotate, Scale, and Translate."
