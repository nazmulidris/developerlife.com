## Introduction

This article is for developers and designers who want to learn how to build responsive web
applications. I‚Äôve been a product designer for more than 6 years, working at my startup and also at
several other startups in the San Francisco Bay Area.

As a designer, while I was working with developers and launching several products, I became more
curious about how they build the apps that I was designing. ü§î My curiosity led me to switch roles
and become a front end web developer. Two years into this journey I am now building web applications
(in addition to designing them).

Everything I design and build is responsive and in this article I will show you how I do it.

## What are responsive web applications?

Responsive web applications are about
[usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability). These web applications
are usable in any browser viewport size (I discuss browser viewports in more detail at the end of
this article).

Let‚Äôs say a user opens a web application in a web browser and resizes the browser viewport size to
be the smallest width, then, resizes the browser window the largest width.

If this user can do what the app is intended to do when the viewport is the smallest size,the
largest size, and all the sizes between those two (without zooming in and out of the application),
only then is the web application responsive.

While explaining the process of designing and building a responsive web application, I am using one
of the apps I‚Äôve built as an example. The web app is called
[Planner](https://maretidris.github.io/planner-web-app/) and it‚Äôs a to-do list app that allows to
organize and track tasks that need to be done.

## Why should we care about making responsive apps?

The main reason is
[global smartphone adoption](https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/).
If your application is intended to be used in a smartphone web browser, then it needs to be
responsive. If the user opens your non-responsive web application and the content is zoomed out /
looks tiny, then the user will have a poor experience in your application (pinching or zooming in
and out in an attempt to use it). If you design your app well and make it responsive, your users
will have a better experience, which may help you and the company you work for achieve the revenue
and/or engagement that you are after.

## How to design and build a responsive application

### 1. Design for smallest and largest viewports

The designer should choose the smallest and largest viewport sizes to design for. I generally design
for 320px as the smallest viewport width and the largest viewport width depends on the nature of the
app. I do that because all modern smartphone screen widths are larger than 320px. Here‚Äôs a pro tip:
I mostly design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent) now, so while I‚Äôm designing the app,
I always open up the design in [Figma Mirror App](https://help.figma.com/article/90-figma-mirror) on
my phone to check if all the clickable areas are large enough, text is readable etc.

In the Planner app example below you can see the designs I created for 320px viewport and larger
than 1400px viewport:

### 2. Build the two designs

First, build the small design. Then add a
[CSS media query breakpoint](https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/) between those two states
(small and large). At this stage, you don‚Äôt know when to add the breakpoint and that‚Äôs ok. Finally,
build out the large design.

The exact breakpoint(s) will be decided later on when working with the designer. The most important
thing in this stage is to make the design fluid, so it‚Äôs possible to resize the viewport size and
see how the design looks like in a larger/smaller viewport.

Here are some suggestions:

- Use `%`when sizing the `width` and `height` of the container.
- Use `max-width: 100%` with images.
- Use [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox),
  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and/or
  [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) if it makes
  development easier.

When your app is fluid, you and the designer can figure out what happens between those two states.

### 3. Work together to make the design look good between the smallest and largest viewports

Now that you have a fluid app, open it in your
[browser‚Äôs developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
with both you and the designer looking at this together.

Set the width of the viewport to the smallest size that the designer chose in their design, and
slowly start resizing the viewport, stretching it larger.

The designer will decide when exactly the design starts to ‚Äúlook odd‚Äù and can be improved. That is
where you (the developer) add a breakpoint.

Now the designer will most likely want to make some changes. If the changes are small, you can do it
in the code right there in the browser‚Äôs developer tools. If the designer is not sure exactly how
the design should look or it will take more time, she/he can write down the size of the viewport in
pixels and design a static artboard in their chosen design tool for that size.

Whenever this design is done, you can implement it, and repeat this viewport resizing process w/ the
designer until you get to the largest viewport.

## Things to keep in mind when making responsive web apps

- Is the most important content visible? For example: if the heading text is too large and takes too
  much space, and hides the content, make it smaller. Another example: is your navigation bar too
  large for the smallest viewport taking up too much valuable space?
- Is the call to action button visible and noticeable?
- Is the text size readable?
- Are the
  [clickable areas](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/)
  of your application large enough when opened up on a browser in a smartphone?
- Could you be using less padding/margin on your small viewport design to allow more space for
  content? Example below:

![]({{ 'assets/9_padding_example.png' | relative_url }})

## Viewport size vs screen/display size

When I use the term ‚Äúviewport‚Äù, I‚Äôm intentionally avoiding words like ‚Äúscreen size‚Äù or ‚Äúdisplay
size‚Äù. Screen and display sizes are set by device manufacturers. You can not change the size of the
screen/display on your device. Your browser‚Äôs viewport size, on the other hand, is fluid. In a
desktop/laptop browser, you can make the viewport as large as your physical device‚Äôs screen size, or
as small as ~ 510px in width in Chrome. In Chrome developer tools you can make a viewport as small
as 50px.

## The confusion with using words like a mobile, tablet and desktop size

Designers create mockups in a static / rigid (not fluid) environment like Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD.
This can result in designers finding it difficult to fully grasp the concept of responsive design.
Their job is to create fluid designs, but the tools are rigid. Designers don‚Äôt know how many
different size Sketch artboards or Figma frames they need to design. Then concepts like mobile size,
tablet size, and desktop size come to play as rough guidelines.

For designers, I would suggest that instead of mobile, tablet and desktop size, use words like
‚Äúsmallest viewport size‚Äù and ‚Äúlarge viewport size‚Äù. From there figure out the in-between viewport
sizes with your developer(s). For example, if you say the following to a developer: ‚Äúthis is a
tablet size design which has a width of 600px‚Äù she/he doesn‚Äôt understand why are you calling it
‚Äútablet size‚Äù, because they can just resize their browser‚Äôs viewport to 600px in their desktop /
laptop (which is obviously not a tablet).

## Wrap up

Web apps always live in a browser. They aren‚Äôt native apps. You can open them up in your desktop and
laptop browser, and you can also open them up in your mobile and tablet browser. This flexibility is
one of the reasons I love designing and building for the web.
