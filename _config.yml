# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I started developerlife.com in Nov 1998 when I couldn’t find a decent tutorial on XML and Java
  to build web based apps, so I decided to write one myself, and this site was born. It served up
  its first tutorial on 31 Dec 1998. Like Alan Kay said: “The best way to predict the future is
  to invent it”.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://localhost:4000" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
