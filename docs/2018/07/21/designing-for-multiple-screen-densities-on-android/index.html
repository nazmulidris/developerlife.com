<p>There were over
<a href="https://opensignal.com/reports/2015/08/android-fragmentation/">24,000 different types of devices running the Android OS</a>
in 2015, and this number has grown since then 😲. There are over 2B devices on the market
according to Google.</p>

<p>Many companies like Samsung, Lenovo, Huawei, LG, and Google make phones, tablets, and
laptops that run on the Android operating system. All these devices have different screen
densities, sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to do a deep dive into Android screen density and provide some
guidance on how to design for such a huge diversity of screen densities. Having a firm
grasp of this is critical in being able to create wireframes and designs in Sketch that
can be implemented on actual devices (phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, wearables).</p>

<p>We are only going to look at phone screen densities, but the same concepts apply to
tablets, TVs, and wearables running the Android OS.</p>
      <h3 id="density">
        
        
          Density <a href="#density">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Density refers to how many pixels have been physically squeezed into a 1 inch x 1 inch
area. In digital displays / screens like monitors, phones, and tablets, density
measurement unit is <strong>PPI **(pixels-per-inch). For print (posters, magazines, and books)
the unit of measurement is **DPI</strong> (dots-per-inch). However, in Android, PPI and DPI are
used interchangeably, and the APIs and docs refer to density in DPI (not PPI).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If a screen has <em>n</em> PPI (or DPI) density then it means it contains that <em>n</em> pixels in a
row and <em>n</em> pixels a column, for a 1 inch x 1 inch size of that screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The image above has 4 different densities: 20 PPI, 60 PPI, 120 PPI and 240 PPI. It’s easy
to see that the more pixels per inch, the sharper the image 👍.</p>
      <h3 id="density-matters">
        
        
          Density matters <a href="#density-matters">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>It is important to understand how density works in order to to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design your wireframes in 1x density in Sketch to make your life (and your developer’s
life 😀) easier.</li>
  <li>Export bitmap images (icons, photos) in 5 different sizes. This ensures that they appear
as sharp as possible devices with different screen densities. And to ensure that memory
and CPU is used efficiently on phones (especially low-end hardware).</li>
</ul>
      <h3 id="images--vector-vs-bitmap">
        
        
          Images — Vector vs Bitmap <a href="#images--vector-vs-bitmap">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Bitmap images are often used for app icons, notification icons, backgrounds of components
in the app, etc. This means that if you want to use bitmaps in your designs (which are
going to be displayed on phone screens of various densities) that you would try and
provide the highest resolution bitmap possible right? Unfortunately, it is not that
simple. 😔</p>

<p>Ideally, you would want to create assets as SVGs in Sketch, and that will ensure that they
are “density independent”. Unlike bitmap images, SVGs can “scale” to fit any size screen
of any density.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVGs files actually contain a set of instructions that tell Android how to accurately
paint an image on a screen of any size or density.</li>
  <li>Bitmaps are “fixed” size and resolution, meaning that the number of pixels are fixed in
every bitmap.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you create vector graphics assets in Sketch this means that the developer will be able
to take them and use
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio">Android Studio</a> to
generate vector drawables (in XML) that they can use in their code. Vector graphics can
scale to any size without losing image sharpness and they tend to be very compact in size
as well.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a 100x100 px bitmap. This image will appear much smaller on a
high-density screen than on a low-density screen. SVG images, on the other hand, will look
“right” no matter what the screen size / density. Bitmaps lose quality when you upsample
them, but they don’t when you downsample them.</p>

<p>If you provided bitmap assets in the highest resolution, then the Android device would
have to do a lot of work to downsample or upsample it and make it look “right” on whatever
screen size the app is running on. This can lead to apps that consume more network, CPU,
and memory than they should, and this results in a poor UX for the user (and has a
negative impact on battery life).</p>

<p>In order to understand what these 5 different sizes in which you need to export your
images are, and to understand what is a 1x density screen is, we need to first look at
“<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#range">logical density buckets</a>”
that have been created for Android.</p>
      <h3 id="logical-density-buckets">
        
        
          Logical Density Buckets <a href="#logical-density-buckets">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Logical density buckets are created by Android to help you and me to stay sane while
exporting images 😛. As I mentioned at the start of this article, many companies use
Android OS to make phones. These phones screens have different physical sizes, densities,
aspect ratios and resolutions. If you had to export images to match each screen size
exactly, then you would have to export a ridiculous number of versions of each asset.
Also, the multitude of those assets would increase the size of the app’s APK.</p>

<p>What Android team did is that they looked at the different screens available and created 6
logical density buckets to group the different screen densities. I am going to show you
only 5, because 1 one of them, the low-density bucket (~120 DPI) is not very common
anymore.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are 5 different buckets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medium density bucket = ~160 DPI = 1x or 100%</li>
  <li>High density bucket = ~240 DPI = 1.5x or 150%</li>
  <li>Extra-high density bucket = ~320 DPI = 2x or 200%</li>
  <li>Extra-extra-high density bucket = ~480 DPI = 3x or 300%</li>
  <li>Extra-extra-extra-high density bucket = ~640 DPI = 4x or 400%</li>
</ul>

<p>Medium density bucket is the baseline density, the 1x density, and all the other densities
are calculated using it’s ~160 DPI as a baseline.</p>

<p>For example, if a device has a 577 DPI screen, then it would belong to XXXHDPI bucket,
which is ~640 DPI. Which means when your bitmap asset is rendered in 577 DPI screen, it
will be scaled down a little bit to 577 DPI from 640 DPI exported asset. Again, this
doesn’t apply to vector graphics.</p>

<p>Currently, the best place where you can go to find out the screen density is
<a href="https://material.io/devices/">Material Design device metrics website</a>. Check out the last
column for density. This website should have most of the devices, but definitely has some
important ones missing like Pixel 2 and Pixel 2XL.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you design 1x, you need to know the density of your phone screen to
understand how much you need to scale your design up in
<a href="https://bjango.com/help/skalapreview/sketch/">Sketch Preview plugin</a> to see a sharp image
on your
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bjango.skalaview&amp;hl=en_US">Skala app on your Android phone</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="ppi-vs-dpi">
        
        
          PPI vs DPI <a href="#ppi-vs-dpi">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>I used PPI (pixels-per-inch) earlier in this article, but Android uses DPI
(dots-per-inch), to describe logical density buckets. This might be confusing, and I’m not
really sure why the Android team chose to use DPI instead of PPI. Because Android uses
DPI, then we end up with names like MDPI, HDPI, XHDPI, XXHDPI, and XXXHDPI, rather than
MPPI, HPPI, XHPPI, XXHPPI and XXXHPPI 😄.</p>
      <h3 id="density-independent-pixels-dp-or-dip">
        
        
          Density-Independent-Pixels (DP or DIP) <a href="#density-independent-pixels-dp-or-dip">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Density-independent-pixels also known as device-independent-pixels help to keep UI
elements the same physical size across the different density devices while maintaining the
element’s sharpness. The denser the screen, the more pixels are required to keep the same
physical size. DPs are only used in Android. In iOS, you need to use Points.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you look at the image above, all of the “buy” buttons appear the same physical size in
different density screens. Even though the amount of DPs (88 x 36 DP) stays the same on
all screens, the amount of pixels it takes to fill that space on each screen increases
according to each screen density.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 1x screen (~160 DPI) 88 x 36 pixels button is equivalent to 88 x 36
density-independent-pixels, because 160 DPI is a baseline density where 1 DP = 1 PX.</li>
  <li>In 1.5x screen (~240 DPI) it takes 1.5 times as many pixels (132 x 54 PX) to fill the
area of 88 x 36 density-independent-pixels.</li>
  <li>In 2x screen (~320 DPI) it takes twice as many pixels (176 x 72 PX) to fill the area of
88 x 36 density-independent-pixels.</li>
  <li>In 3x screen (~480 DPI) it takes three times as many pixels (264 x 108 PX) to fill the
area of 88 x 36 density-independent-pixels.</li>
  <li>In 4x screen (~640 DPI) it takes four times as many pixels (352 x 144 PX) to fill the
area of 88 x 36 density-independent-pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using bitmaps, rather than vectors, then you need to export each bitmap in all
sizes (1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x). If you are using Sketch, then you most likely will have
vector graphics and you don’t need to worry about it.</p>

<p>DPs are great if we don’t want to specify in each individual density what the sizes of our
UI elements should be. For example, if a button needs to be 88 x 36 PX in 1x design and
also 132 x 54 PX in 1.5x design and so on until the 4x design, it’s easier to use DPs and
note that button needs to be 88 x 36 DP and this measurement applies to all density
screens.</p>

          Width and height in DP <a href="#width-and-height-in-dp">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>In order to create 1x design, you need to know your test device width and height in DP.</p>

<p>If you are using one of the popular Android phones as your test device, then you will find
its width and height in DP from the
<a href="https://material.io/devices/">Material Design device metrics website</a>. Pixel 2’s width
and height in dp is 411 x 731 dp, the same as Pixel.</p>

<p>Whatever these numbers are in DP, that is the size your artboard in pixels in Sketch. If
you are designing for Pixel, then your artboard size is 411 x 731 px.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/density-6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you want to see an example of this,
<a href="https://nadiaidris.com/uamp.html#sketch">here’s a 1x design</a> I created using Sketch for
an Android app called UAMP (Universal Android Music Player). if you download the Sketch
file (from the <a href="https://nadiaidris.com/uamp.html#sketch">high fidelity mockup section</a>),
you will find that the size of each artboard is 411 x 731 px.</p>

          Designing for 1x vs other densities <a href="#designing-for-1x-vs-other-densities">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>I recommend that you design in 1x, but you can design for 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 3.5x, or 4x if you
choose. The following are some benefits of designing in 1x:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use Material Design guidelines 1 to 1. By that I mean,
<a href="https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#baseline">8dp in your grid</a> will
be 8 pixels in Sketch.</li>
  <li>Your developer will be building the app using DPs. If you design 1x, they don’t have to
calculate 1x design measurements from the larger design you created. They can simply
take measurements in pixels and the value is the same in DPs in their code. However, if
you designed 3.5x, then the developer will have to divide all values by 3.5. Don’t make
your developer have to calculate DP values 😃.</li>
</ul>
