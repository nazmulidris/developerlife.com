## My story

I've brought products to life from a glimmer of a vision to a team building it, to having
customers, and eventually seeing the product come to an end. I've worked as part of large
and small teams and led them to make impossible things possible.

I have over 20 years of leadership:

- 12 years in software engineering.
- 8 years in design and product management experience.

As a multifaceted engineer, designer, and communicator, Iâ€™ve focused on creating,
designing, building, and collaborating with people to bring amazing user experiences to
life across multiple platforms.

Highlights:

- Coding in Rust, Kotlin, TypeScript, React, WASM, WASI, TUI / CLI, GUI, Node.js, Java.
- Worked on Android Studio IDE (JetBrains based) in Kotlin & Java.
- Was principal SWE, founder, and CEO of a startup (TRNQL) in 2015.
  - Raised 1.5M in venture funding.
  - Successfully built and launched developer-facing SDKs for Android & iOS.
  - Created & led teams that served many users & developers on Android & iOS.
- Currently create content for prominent developer tutorial site developerlife.com (est
  1998).

## Leadership and Resourcefulness

- Was founder and CEO of TRNQL Inc, a startup to build SDKs for iOS and Android in 2014

- Raised \$1.5M of VC funding

- Recruited and managed team of 6 people

- Created and shipped SDKs that collects valuable signals from Android and iOS devices
  that fed ML to better understand human behavior

## Software Engineering

### Technologies

- Experienced in building mobile apps and SDKs, web apps and APIs, IDEs, and web services

- Well versed in Kotlin, Java, Android, Test driven development, TypeScript, Rust,
  Node.js, WASM, WASI, JavaScript, Jest, React, Redux, Python, React Native, Firebase,
  databases (SQL & NoSQL), CLI apps, GUI desktop apps

### Mobile app development toolkits & infrastructure

- Created Android app development container and SDK (built on top of Android framework to
  expose contextual awareness to any app for TRNQL)

- Created BlackBerry app development container (with custom UI toolkits, animation
  libraries, networking, and app lifecycle management)

- Created Java desktop app development containers (with custom UI toolkits, animation
  libraries, networking, and app lifecycle management) for Rich Internet Applications

### Cloud Infrastructure

- Created a cross platform PaaS service in Java, built on top of Tomcat, similar to Google
  App Engine that powered ScreamingToaster BlackBerry apps (from 2006 to 2011. and then
  became the server backend for TRNQL SDK offering (from 2015-2016)

- Created DSLs to declaratively generate persistence, networking, data models, and data
  binding. Created source code generators to take DSLs and generate code in Java for
  server, Android, and BlackBerry, and even JavaScript for web

- This server supported web, iOS, Android, BlackBerry clients

- It also supported payments integration and issuing app licenses and managing app
  subscriptions

### Cross platform development toolkits & infrastructure

- Created Web app development containers to integrate seamlessly with cloud infrastructure
  and a multitude of mobile clients (Android, BlackBerry, iOS) from 2009 to 2011

### Android apps

Apps I've published to the Play Store:

- ExtraTKT in 2009
- [TRNQL interplay in 2015](https://apkpure.com/trnql-interplay/com.trnql.sample_interplay)
- [StayAwake in 2017](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.r3bl.stayawake&hl=en_US)

### BlackBerry Apps

- I was a finalist **twice** in the Global BlackBerry Developer Conference in 2009 and
  2010 for best app in the world (Wicked blogging app, and RainOrShine weather app)

- I published 4 apps that were used by 100's of thousands of users globally from 2006 to
  2011

  - Wicked blogging app for BlackBerry
  - MyListy list app for BlackBerry and Web
  - DulyNoted note taking app for BlackBerry and Web
  - RainOrShine weather app for BlackBerry (was top 5 weather apps in BlackBerry App World
    for a while) and was featured in the App World

### Middleware infrastructure for mobile

- Created underlying technology to enable servers to integrate with multiple client
  platforms using low level sockets communications, custom binary data transmission
  protocols, complete custom app servers, and even custom mobile app UI markup languages
  from 1999 to 2004

- Created high performance application data network infrastructure to deliver push updates
  from server to client, and a whole host of other innovations (see patent)

## Communication

I've led the creation of developer narratives and scaled them out at Google, eg: I created
the first design workshops for developers at IO13 & IO14. I've founded and presented at
the Design for Humans (in real life) meetup. I've created the UX Design for Mobile class
on Udacity, and my own UX Design show on YouTube both for Google. I also run and create
content for a very prominent developer tutorial site called
[developerlife.com](http://developerlife.com) (which was established in 1998).

- Created developerlife.com tutorials on Android, Kotlin, React, Redux, and React Native,
  that has been around since â€˜98 and has over 10M pageviews

- Created & ran UX Design experiential workshops for developers at Google IO13 and IO14
  hosting over 2k attendees â€“ [bit.ly/2o3oAni](http://bit.ly/2o3oAni)

- Founded and grew Design for Humans meetup group to 2k members for UX design. Iâ€™ve
  presented at over 34 meetups, and over 4k developer & designer attendees â€“
