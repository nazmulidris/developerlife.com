    Hi, I'm Nazmul Idris. I am a Googler, entrepreneur, leader, coder, designer, dancer, TaiChi’er,
    Yogi, racer, healer, storyteller. I’m about leadership, authenticity, and empowerment.

    I started this website in Nov 1998 when I couldn’t find a decent tutorial on XML and Java
    to build web based apps, so I decided to write one myself, and this site was born. Today I cover
    Android, Web, Cloud technologies, and UX engineering and design topics.
