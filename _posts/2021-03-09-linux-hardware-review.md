## From Windows, to macOS, to Ubuntu (Linux)

Before getting to the the desktop and laptop hardware reviews, I would like to share my journey of how I arrived here. I
became a big fan of Ubuntu and GNOME in the last few years, and I recently switched to using Ubuntu full time as my
laptop and desktop environment for both work and personal use cases.

Prior to that I was using Linux and macOS in my day job and macOS for my personal computing environment. Like many
developers, I really enjoyed the incredible vertical integration of macOS software and Apple hardware, and loved that
macOS is a BSD based operating system and has a "real" terminal. And before that I primarily used Windows in the 90s,
before switching to macOS X in early 2000's.

However, I've been looking to switch to Linux for the last 2-3 years (2017-2019) ever since:

1. Overheating issues on MacBook Pro laptops became so bad that these machines weren't really usable for any sustained
   workloads. And there had been a dearth of desktop computing options for macOS.
2. macOS is getting more and more locked down (it biases apps to be deployed via the Apple App Store, and
   [Catalina started the "notarization" requirement](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/23/apple-mac-app-notarization-february-2020/)
   for apps that are not delivered via the App Store) restricts choice for me as a developer and user.

## Waiting for desktop Linux to mature (which happened in late 2020)

I've been waiting for desktop Linux to mature so that I could switch to it full time. And that time happened for me at
the end of 2020. It was incredible to see this
[Lenovo announcement](https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-brings-linux-certification-to-ThinkPad-and-thinkstation-workstation-portfolio-easing-deployment-for-developers-data-scientists/)
in support of Linux. And [Dell](http://dell.com/linux) had already thrown their weight behind Linux even before that!
And of course [System76](https://system76.com/) even before that. What is incredible about Lenovo and ThinkPads is that
there is no need to deal with adding custom PPAs to get hardware drivers (this isn't the case for Dell or System76)!

Between 2017 and 2020, I purchased various Dell laptops, System76 laptops and desktops, and even ThinkPad X series
laptops to try Ubuntu on them. And overall they had some issue or another.

- The Dell laptops worked really well (XPS and Precision Mobile line of mobile workstations). The only exceptions is
  that I ordered an XPS 15 laptop w/ OLED panels, and they were simply not supported. But with non OLED panels, Linux
  worked pretty well.
- The ThinkPad X1 Extreme machine that I ordered was too "new", and I had all kinds of kernel issues and lack of support
  for the WiFi card. And even after getting that to work, the power management was not good at all leading to some awful
  battery life and performance issues.
- The System76 laptops that I got were nothing "special" in terms of hardware (the
  [open firmware](https://github.com/system76/firmware-open) on them is special and awesome). These laptops are
  currently just rebranded [Clevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clevo) machines (a Taiwanese OEM). I am personally
  waiting for System76 to create their own custom laptops just like they do their Thelio desktop. I am also very
  impressed that they have open sourced their mechanical keyboard hardware design (called
  [`launch`](https://github.com/system76/launch)) as well recently!

In 2020, I was really impressed w/ the System76 Thelio desktop, and ended up ordering one as well, but returned it in
favor of the Dell Precision 3440 that I currently have. I am deeply impressed by AMD Ryzen on Thelio as well as PCI
Express 4.0 (w/ 7Gbps read and 5Gbps write speeds for SSDs). My next desktop is going to be a Thelio üòÄ. And this leads
us to the hardware reviews üéâ.

## Dell Precision 3440 small form factor workstation

The
[Dell Precision 3440](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/precision-3440-workstation/xctop3440us_vivp?configurationid=c460c7e5-e696-4ad5-ade0-ab0cad0c87e9)
is a very small computer. It packs a lot of punch though. This machine came out just at the end of 2020. And it featured
an upgraded Xeon CPU line w/ more cores (10 core). I didn't know this at the time, but this is a big change for this
enterprise class machine in many years.

The spec that I ordered was w/ the Xeon W-1290 (10 Core), 64GB of non-ECC RAM, 512GB SSD, and NVIDIA Quadro P1000 4GB
GPU. If I were to to do it over again, I would get a CPU w/ fewer cores, since my workloads can't be parallelized much
(lots of mostly single threaded tasks, or slightly multi-threaded tasks). Actually if I were to do it over again, I
would get a [System76 Thelio](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-r2/configure) machine w/ PCEe 4.0 and the AMD 4th Gen
Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, with the double speed SSDs (7GB/s read, and 5GB/s read). The System76 comes w/ Ubuntu 20.04 or PopOS!
20.04, whereas the Dell only ships w/ Ubuntu 18.04.

### Pros

- The machine is incredibly small, packs a big punch, is incredibly fast, and can handle just about anything I can throw
  at it which includes Google Chrome, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, gradle, npm, webpack, Java and Kotlin toolchain, Ruby, TS
  and JS (browser and node environments).
- The IO is incredibly fast on this machine, and it can handle most compilation tasks w/ ease. I even installed
  [`pigz`](https://zlib.net/pigz/) on this box to make better use of the abundant cores to do file compression and
  expansion.
- Thermal management is excellent. Even over sustained workloads. However, when the fan does kick in, it is very loud!
  Sounds like a plane about to take off.
- To compile the [JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) IDE took about
  6 minutes on this machine. I used Amazon `corretto-11` JDK, and applied the parallel compiler optimization settings in
  the README. To give you some context, it takes about 22 minutes to build the same project on a top of the line 2020
  MacBook Pro 16" laptop (w/ i9 CPU and 32 GB of RAM) ... this is with a case sensitive filesystem enabled! It is even
  slower when using the default APFS case insensitive filesystem!
  [EXTFS4](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/filesystems.5.html) is fast!
- The build in SSD is as advertised. It gets roughly 3.2GB/s read and 2.9GB/s write. I was able to improve the
  performance slightly (by about 12% for read and write) by using the new generation SSD from Samsung (which is made for
  PCI Express 4.0 systems)
  [980 PRO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GL575DB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The average
  access times were much better w/ the new 980 PRO as well (0.02 ms vs 0.42 ms). So it is worth the upgrade üëç.

### Cons

- It does not support PCI Express 4.0, and the System76 Thelio has a big edge over this machine in terms of disk IO.
- Dell has installed Ubuntu 18.04 on this machine, which is getting long in the tooth now.
- Even though the case is a tool-less design, because the chassis is so tiny, it does require you to remove lots of
  stuff inside of it in order to get to memory and SSD. So if you want to add the 980 PRO SSD you have to remove the
  empty drive bays just to get to the single SSD slot.
- The built in Bluetooth chip is not good. I had to use an external USB Bluetooth dongle from Plugable that I purchased
  from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- If you don't like really loud fan noises, then this machine might not be the one to get. Puget Systems makes a really
  quiet Linux workstation called [Serenity](https://www.pugetsystems.com/nav/serenity/Professional/customize.php) that
  you can take a look at if sound deadening is important to you.
- Dell offers an image with all the drivers installed. The only issue w/ this image is that if you choose to use full
  disk encryption using [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) then you will have to add the
  drivers manually (which is a pain). Also to figure out which drivers to install manually, you have to dig around the
  `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` and then use something like
  [Synaptic package manager](https://itsfoss.com/synaptic-package-manager/) to figure out which `apt` packages are event
  installed from these [PPAs](https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/). This is an area where the ThinkPad putting all the
  required drivers in the official `apt` repositories is really a great advantage.

## Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition (2021 w/ Tigerlake 11th gen CPU and Intel Xe integrated graphics)

I ordered this machine in Dec 2020 and waited almost a month for it to arrive. Dell offers this machine in pretty much
just one spec. You can only choose the display and SSD options. I wasn't sure if an ultra portable machine would be
enough for my workflow. And boy was I surprised!

This Tigerlake 11th gen CPU architecture from Intel w/ the integrated Xe graphics are out of this world! Thermal
management is epic! This machine can run at high clock speeds for a long period of time and not give in to weak
thermals. Even under heavy workloads, this machine doesn't get very hot, and when it does get warm, you can barely hear
the fan kicking in. This is an awesome machine and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone!

Build quality is excellent. It feels like a premium product. It feels like a passion project from folks at Dell who
worked on this machine! The laptop is featherweight as well! Battery life is great too.

It also comes with Ubuntu 20.04 out of the box, which is great. The display is one of the best I've ever seen in any
laptop. The keyboard is ok. Not the best, but not the worst. And the touchpad is decent as well. I connected this to a
Thunderbolt dock and it just works flawlessly with external drives, keyboards, mice, and monitors. I can't think of any
big knocks against this machine. It is near perfect. If you want an awesome tightly vertically integrated product that
just works flawlessly, then this is the machine for you!

The only con that I can think of is the one that applies to the Precision as well, which is related to the use of custom
PPAs to deliver hardware drivers. And the inability to use LUKS full disk encryption from the factory OS image (which is
what the recovery media will install).

In terms of my benchmarks, to compile the
[JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) IDE took about 16 minutes on
this machine. I used Amazon `corretto-11` JDK, and applied the parallel compiler optimization settings in the README.

This machine is only 2.7 x slower than the Dell Precision above to compile IDEA. And it is faster than the MacBook Pro
16 2020 (which takes about 22 minutes).

SSD speeds are great as well, and are as advertised, roughly 3.5GB/s read, and 3.1GB/s write. Average access times are
in the order of 0.02 ms.

## ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8

I ordered this machine at the same time that I ordered the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. This X1 Carbon Gen 8 machine
works flawlessly with Ubuntu. You can get it from the factory with Ubuntu preinstall. The only change you have to make
to run this on Windows or Linux is one setting in the BIOS (regarding the sleep state of the CPU). There are no custom
PPAs for driver software. So you can just boot from a Linux Live CD (ISO) and you can install Ubuntu 20.04 and you are
good to go! Everything (keyboard functions like screen brightness control, volume, and media control, sleep/resume, etc)
just works!

The build quality is excellent. This thing is light. I love carbon fiber construction! Battery life is great. Keyboard
and touchpad are great. Screen is great. Thermal management is great, however it runs way hotter than the XPS 13 (which
is on Intel's 11th gen CPU vs this one's 10th gen one).

There is one major flaw this machine has. It is slow. Like really slow. Even the system UI feels sluggish compared to
the Dell XPS 13.

In terms of my benchmarks, to compile the
[JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) IDE took about 48 minutes on
this machine. I used Amazon `corretto-11` JDK, and applied the parallel compiler optimization settings in the README.
This machine is 8 x slower than the Dell Precision above to compile IDEA. And it is 3 x slower than the Dell XPS 13!

Disk IO is as advertised. It got 3.1GB/s read, 2.4GB/s write, and 0.20 ms average access time. So even the IO is slower
than the Dell XPS 13 and Precision.

I returned this laptop and kept the Dell XPS 13 üëç.
