## Introduction
<a id="markdown-introduction" name="introduction"></a>


In this tutorial we will learn how to use [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) by example to
manage project specific commands. `just` is like `make`, but it is written in Rust, and it works
with `cargo`.

Before we get started, please take a look at the
[`just` project README](https://github.com/casey/just).

Let's say you have a `justfile` that looks like this, and it has a single recipe called
`list`:

```
list:
  ls -l
```

And you run it by typing `just list`. It just turns around and runs this `sh -c "ls -l"`.
That's it. So on Windows, this doesn't work, because `sh` isn't installed by default. So
you have to install cygwin. And then you have to install `just` and then you have to
install `sh`.

Alternatively, you can specify that you want to use `powershell` instead by
adding this to the top of the `justfile`: `set shell := ["powershell.exe", "-c"]`. Or you
can just run this `just --shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c list` to run `just` itself
at the command prompt.

You can also supply different shell interpreters like `python` or `node`. And you can even
provide `shebang` lines like `#!/usr/bin/env python` or `#!/usr/bin/env node` at the top
of each recipe.

## Prerequisites
<a id="markdown-prerequisites" name="prerequisites"></a>


ðŸŒ  In order for our `just` file to work, we must first install the Rust toolchain and `just` and
`cargo-watch`:

1. Install the Rust toolchain using `rustup` by following the instructions
   [here](https://rustup.rs/).
1. Install `cargo-watch` using `cargo install cargo-watch`.
1. [Install](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) `just` on your system using
   `cargo install just`. It is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
   - If you want shell completions for `just` you can follow
     [these instructions](https://github.com/casey/just#shell-completion-scripts).
   - If you install `just` using `cargo install just` or `brew install just` you will not get shell
     completions without doing one extra configuration step. So on Linux it is best to use
     `sudo apt install -y just` if you want them.

## Basic usage
<a id="markdown-basic-usage" name="basic-usage"></a>

For Rust projects, typically we will have a build, run, test project specific commands. Let's start
with these simple ones first. The benefit of `just` is that we can use it to run these commands on
any platform (Linux, Mac, Windows). And we don't need to create OS or shell specific scripts to do
this ðŸŽ‰.

Let's start by creating a `justfile` in the root of our project. The `justfile` is where we will
define our project specific commands. Here is what it looks like for the
[`r3bl_ansi_color` repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/ansi_color/justfile):

```text
build:
  cargo build

clean:
  cargo clean

run:
  cargo run --example main
```

These are pretty simple commands. The syntax is pretty simple. The first line is the command name.
And the second line is the command to run. The command can be a single command or a series of
commands.

Now in order to run this, we can just run `just --list` in the root of our project. And it will show
us the list of commands that we can run.

```bash
$ just --list
Available recipes:
    build
    clean
    run
```

Then to run a command, we can just run `just <command_name>`. For example, to run the `build`
command, we can run `just build`.

```bash
$ just build
```

## Advanced usage
<a id="markdown-advanced-usage" name="advanced-usage"></a>

### Running many different commands
<a id="markdown-running-many-different-commands" name="running-many-different-commands"></a>

This is pretty straightforward. You can just list all other other just commands inline.
Here's an example.

```
all: clean build test clippy docs rustfmt
```

The `all` command will run the other commands in the order they're written.

### Run on Windows
<a id="markdown-run-on-windows" name="run-on-windows"></a>

Currently our `justfile` will run on Linux and macOS. To make it run on Windows, we can
run `just` itself using `powershell.exe`. Here is what it looks like:

```shell
just --shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c build
```

Or we can add the line `set shell := ["powershell.exe", "-c"]` to the top of the
`justfile`.

Alternatively, we can use `nu` shell instead of `powershell.exe` since it is written in
Rust and available via `cargo install nu`.

### Run in CI / CD environments (Github Actions)
<a id="markdown-run-in-ci-%2F-cd-environments-github-actions" name="run-in-ci-%2F-cd-environments-github-actions"></a>

Let's add a new command called `all` to our `justfile`. This will just turn around and run the
`build` and `clean` commands. Here is what it looks like:

```
all: build clean
```

Now, we can also use `just` in CI / CD environments. For example, here is the [`rust.yml`
file](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/ansi_color/.github/workflows/rust.yml)
for this repo's Github Actions. It runs `just all` in the `build` step.

The one thing to note is that we are installing `just` in the docker container before we
run the `just` command. We do this by pulling in the prebuilt binary for Ubuntu as shown
[here](https://github.com/casey/just#pre-built-binaries): `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2
-sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST`

```yaml
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Install just before running it below.
    - name: Install just
      run: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin

    # Simply run the `just all` command.
    - name: all
      run: just all
```

Using `just all` is relatively straightforward way to run all our build steps (that would
run in a CI / CD environment) on our local computer w/out installing docker. While
ensuring that these same steps are carried out in the CI / CD environment.

### Pass arguments into commands
<a id="markdown-pass-arguments-into-commands" name="pass-arguments-into-commands"></a>

We can also pass arguments into our commands. Let's say that we have a command that we can use to
run a single test. We can pass the name of the test into the command. Here is what it looks like:

<!--

  - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/
 -->
{% raw %}
```bash
watch-one-test test_name:
  # More info on cargo test: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html
  # More info on cargo watch: https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch
  cargo watch -x check -x 'test -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture {{test_name}}' -c -q
```
{% endraw %}

There are a few things to note here:

1. The syntax to name the command is still the same as before.
1. However, we have added another string after the command name, which is the argument name
   `test_name`. If an argument is not passed in then `just` will display an error and print a
   message stating that an argument is required.
1. This argument is used just like a variable would in a `justfile`. The `{{` and `}}` enclose a
   variable name.

Now we can run this command by passing in the name of the test that we want to run. For example, if
we want to run the `test_ansi_color` test, we can run `just watch-one-test test_ansi_color`.

```bash
$ just watch-one-test bold
```

Here's an example of a `justfile` that has a lot more commands for you to look at:
[r3bl_ansi_color justfile](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/ansi_color/justfile).

## Next steps

The `just` project [README](https://github.com/casey/just) has lots of information on how to use
`just`. It is best to have a specific thing you are looking for before you visit this page. Here are
some interesting links inside the README:

1. [Command line arguments](https://github.com/casey/just#recipe-parameters).
1. [Support for .env files](https://github.com/casey/just#dotenv-integration).
1. [Conditional expressions](https://github.com/casey/just#conditional-expressions).
