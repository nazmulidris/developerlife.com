For the longest time I used to think that I was the sum total of my accomplishments. I thought that
life was about accomplishments. It was only about reaching the outcome. It was about getting the
prize. The journey to get there was largely ignored by me. What I didn‚Äôt realize is how empty life
had become while I was focused only on achieving outcomes.

This is the story of how I came to understand what it means to just be, or be in the moment, in all
situations. This [article]({{'/2015/10/31/how-i-got-everything-wrong-about -everything/' |
relative_url }}) will give you some insight on why I thought this way in my "past" life.

## Vanity metrics

It‚Äôs an interesting thing, being measured against something that another person has created (without
any input from oneself). It‚Äôs not a win-win proposition.

- **If you measure up**, then you will not be satisfied, since this criteria is set by someone else,
  and there‚Äôs no inherent value to you for fitting this mold. Unless you find value in the criteria,
  they become meaningless vanity metrics once you‚Äôve achieved them.

- **If you don‚Äôt measure up**, then you won‚Äôt be satisfied with yourself, since this will get you
  down on yourself for not reaching this arbitrary and meaningless criteria set by someone else. To
  add insult to injury, you will probably stop trying and stop self expressing if this how you chose
  to live your life.

Either ways, you lose. This had been my life until about 3 years ago. After experiencing great loss
I realized that I am not the sum total of the things that I do. I am the sum total of who I am when
I show up in the world. I can‚Äôt control how people see me. I can only control what I show people ‚Äî
which is the light that I choose to shine, or hide, on the inside. And that is how I show up in the
world ‚Äî by either hiding my inner light or by shining it brightly (unobstructed by myself). And I
have to make this choice in all situations in life (alone, with other people, in any context). And
these choices put together is who I am, regardless of what I do.

## Who I am vs What I do

It‚Äôs not about about what I do, what tasks I perform poorly or well, what relationships I have with
people, and what accolades I garner or don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not about doing things and being with people and
going to places. If I show up in the wrong light (by obstructing my own light by being afraid), then
I‚Äôm defeating myself in all situations and scenarios. It‚Äôs about striving to show up in the right
light in all moments. Not just special moments or special places or situations or around specific
people.

The difficult thing about accepting this paradigm is that you first have to let go of all the things
that you have accumulated thus far. For me, these things were part of my identity ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt my
real identity. It was a cheap and hollow proxy for who I was! Great loss is what enabled me to see
that when I was stripped of all these things. And only then was I ready to understand what it means
to be, to understand who I was. Every curse is a blessing, and every blessing is a curse ‚Äî such is
the Tao of the ‚Äòverse.

## Showing up in the Wrong light

In most of the interpersonal relationships that I‚Äôve had in the past, I would always make a point to
read the other person‚Äôs emotional state, and show up in a light in which they needed me to appear.
If they were feeling down, then I would be cheery. If they needed support, then I would be strong. I
never stopped to think what I wanted to feel, or what light I wanted to show up in, the light that
wasn‚Äôt influenced by their needs or influence. This thought never occurred to me. This led me to
remove my authentic self from situations. And it became about disappearing so that I can fit the
expectations and needs of other people. Not only was this a very poor way in which to treat myself,
it also consumed a tremendous amount of energy in me (to constantly manage my responses to another‚Äôs
emotional state), and created so much internal conflict, confusion, and chaos. I was always a
distant 3rd and the other person was always 1st. This was also fed by the fact that I didn‚Äôt how to
be when I was alone ‚Äî all very bad things. These all led me to the opposite state of ‚Äújust being‚Äù.

Since my [reboot]({{'/2015/10/31/how-i-got-everything-wrong-about-everything /'
| relative_url }}), I‚Äôve been cultivating the habit to ask myself what it is that I need, and how I want
to be in specific situations and scenarios. How DO I want to feel around people and places and things?
And how do I NOT want to feel?

## Showing up in the Right light

An example of this is how I mustered up the courage, and put my fear and insecurities behind me, and
lead my beloved company (trnql), and be someone that instills confidence in other people (my team,
investors, partners, and customers). In the beginning of my startup journey, when I pitched the idea
of my company to investors, I was really fixated on what their reactions were, how I was perceived,
and what I had to do in order to get them to have the correct reaction. This totally took me out of
the moment. Instead of being myself, and just allowing my inner faith in my vision and my mission
and my team come thru, it became about reading the other people and fitting their expectations.
After a few pitches, I changed my perspective and changed this behavior. I started fixating on who I
was, why I‚Äôm doing this (starting my company), why I believe in this, and what I aim to do. I was
ready to accept rejection (which is totally an outcome that will happen with this approach) and
process it and move on. And I was intensely focused on monitoring my mental state, and cultivating
the mindset that if I am my authentic self, and someone else resonates with this, then it‚Äôs a good
fit, and we should work together. If not, then we shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not about pleasing other people,
it‚Äôs about being efficient with time and energy and find the right fit as soon as possible, without
distraction, in all situations.

So, before pitches, I go on walks. And I put my fears and insecurities aside (you can read my mind
hack [here]({{'/2015/10/31/how-i-got-everything-wrong-about-everything/' |
relative_url }})). And I think about all the impossible things that I‚Äôve accomplished already (in a really
short amount of time and without really knowing the exact how, what, and when). With very few resources,
I‚Äôve been able to create a product that is starting to get traction. I‚Äôve been able to heal and been
able to reach a place in my life where I can write articles like this in public. And on and on. Then
I always ask myself ‚Äî who and how do I want to be. If I could be seen, and wasn‚Äôt hiding, what light
would I shine from within? What light would I want others to see me in. And then I shine that light,
and stop thinking about the molds that other people might want me to fit in, and what would please them.
And everything stops being about pleasing others and instead becomes about finding win-win scenarios
quickly!

In doing so, something amazing happened. By cultivating the habit to show up in any scenario, and
being the person that I wanted to be in that moment, people responded! The right kind of people
responded very positively, and the wrong people were turned off pretty quickly! And this was
wonderful. I started to get good or bad feedback fast!

I had successfully started to stop the waste of my energy in so many situations around people and
places and things. I was able to quickly weed out the wrong audience and find the right one. More
importantly, by cultivating this habit of being seen, I was able to really start dealing with
rejection, instead of hiding from it, behind the veil of changing who I appeared to be, to please
others. This has been incredibly liberating.

## Letting go

It‚Äôs been a journey to get this type of habit applied to every aspect of my life, not just
fundraising, or leading and running my company. I‚Äôve taken my learnings from being a new CEO and
have applied them to my personal life ‚Äî and I wish I could have done this sooner üòÄ.

I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs in the quiet moments, when I‚Äôm alone and have some time on my hands, that I
really have to think about what I want to do, then the question arises ‚Äî what would I do, if there
was no fear involved in the decision? This is where instilling the habit (of showing up in your
light) is so important, because soon it will become the only way to be... and the old patterns
become an exception, and this the new norm.

I used to think that to achieve outcomes you have to figure out the **who**, the **when**, and the
**how**. Being an engineer, I have a bias to fixate on the **how** üòÄ. Now I‚Äôm learning that you
just have to know the why and what (which is not easy, especially since you have to be crystal clear
about these things, and you have to know what you want first). How do you find what you want? You
have to try and you have to fail fast, and learn, and then make some new mistakes and stop repeating
the old ones. Eg: I was so clueless about what I wanted that I ordered a Porsche Cayman R once, and
then at the last minute after it arrived, decided to get a used Porsche 911 Turbo. Well, I hated the
turbo. I was so clueless about what I wanted, I didn‚Äôt even know which car would make me happy.
Well, I‚Äôve learned since then, and I‚Äôm super happy with my Porsche Cayman GTS... and I lust after
the Cayman GT4 and the McLaren 570S. Make an effort to know thyself, is what I‚Äôm saying üòÄ. And this
is an iterative process, as our needs might change as we evolve, so have patience with thyself üòÅ.

Once you know what you want, then just show up in every moment, in every place, and around every
person, doing things in the light that you want to be seen in. You are the creator of this light.
And you have the choice to do this, or not. And if you do, it stops becoming about the things that
you do, and it starts becoming about who you are in all situations. It‚Äôs about overcoming your fears
and insecurities, and getting out of your own way, and accepting the unknown ‚Äî which is that the
**who**, **when**, and **how** isn‚Äôt known at first, but once you set the **why** and **what**, they
will be revealed over time. Easier to type this than do it üòÄ. Easier to think it than be it üòÄ.

You don‚Äôt have to try so hard and find people and situations and tasks to do, so that you can be
seen by others, in a way that they will like you. If you stop looking for this and start focusing on
who you want to be, and be that person, in every moment, and let go of your fears, then you will
have really good outcomes. You just have to accept that you don‚Äôt know the **how** or **when** or
**who** anyway (and this isn‚Äôt easy).

## It‚Äôs all hard work, so focus on the right thing

You‚Äôre working hard either way (by being someone you‚Äôre not, or by letting go and being someone you
are). It‚Äôs not any easier to be yourself at first. So think of this as shifting your focus from
trying hard to be someone that you think others want to be in a situation, to just being yourself.
If you‚Äôve conditioned yourself to not be yourself and be seen in your light, like I had done over a
long period of time, it will take some effort to overcome that inertia (and great loss helped
turbocharge that for me). By shifting your focus, you will actually get results for the hard work
that you‚Äôre putting it ‚Äî that‚Äôs the most important difference in the two approaches.

So whether you are going on a walk, or you are walking to your car, or you are alone at home, or you
are walking around in a mall, or at a networking event, or sitting at a coffee shop, or at a job
interview, or on a date... in the most mundane of life situations and in the most significant
moments of truth, the habit is the same. Strive to show up in the world in the right light ‚Äî in your
light.

<p class="big-quote">You don‚Äôt control how people see you. You only control what
you show people, which is the light that you choose to shine or not, to reveal
or obfuscate, what's on the inside.</p>

To being the most authentic, reduced, and awesome versions of ourselves!
