I started developerlife.com in Nov 1998 when I couldnâ€™t find a decent tutorial 
on XML and Java to build web based apps, so I decided to write one myself, and 
this site was born. It served up its [first tutorial on on 31 Dec 
1998](http://xml.coverpages.org/idris199901.html) with the following announcement
to the `xlxp-dev@fsc.fujitsu.com` mailing list.

Dear fellow Java and XML Developers:

I could not find a decent resource on the web which showed me
how to use XML and Java to build web and Internet based
applications. So I decided to write one myself :).

Check it out at:

    http://developerlife.com
    http://developerlife.com/xmljavatutorial1

It shows you how to use:
    1) the IBM parser (IBM XML Parser for Java)
    2) the Sun parser (Sun ProjectX EA2)
    3) the DOM (org.w3c.dom.*) interfaces
    4) JFC/Swing with XML
    5) Servlets with XML
    6) and much, much more!

Enjoy!
Have a Happy New Year!!!

Like [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) said:
>The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

It grew to become a trusted resource to professional programmers, college 
students, universities, research institutions, [standards 
bodies](http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlFAQ15.html#JAVA-GEN), online magazines, 
and even enterprise software vendors.

Since then technologies have come and gone, and I have created tutorials on 
many varied topics. The goal of the content is in service of the creation of 
technology that adapts to the needs of humans.

You can see how this site has evolved since the beginning in the [Internet 
Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/developerlife.com).
