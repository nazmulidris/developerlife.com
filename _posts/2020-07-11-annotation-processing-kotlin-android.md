# Get the source code

You can find the code for this project in
[this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nazmulidris/annotation-processing/tree/main/kotlin-android-project). This tutorial
is meant to give you some context and describe the structure of this repo and the intended goals. Please clone the repo
and play w/ it as you're reading this tutorial, since most of the code in the repo is simply not provided or repeated in
this tutorial. Also, the code is documented and structured in a readable way, so you can follow along w/out this
tutorial if you like to learn that way.

# End goals of this project

This project shows how to create annotation processors using Kotlin and Android. The main example is a RecyclerView
whose adapter is generated via annotations.

Here's what the annotated code looks like for a "data model" class, which is simply a class w/ some properties that need
to be mapped to each row of a RecyclerView (which is declared in `row_renderer_simple.xml`).

## Using our annotations

There are only 2 annotations:

1. Class level annotation `@AdapterModel`. This generates a source file w/ the name `Adapter` appended at the end of the
   name of the class annotated w/ this. For the example below, the `PersonModelAdapter` class is generated.
2. Property level annotation `@ViewHolderBinding`. These can be added to properties of the class that has been annotated
   w/ `@AdapterModel`.

```kotlin
@AdapterModel(R.layout.row_renderer_simple)
data class PersonModel(
    @ViewHolderBinding(R.id.title) val name: String,
    @ViewHolderBinding(R.id.subtitle) val address: String
)
```

Here's what the code looks like in the simple Activity that loads a bunch of data, which is then displayed in a
RecyclerView. The magic here is that the `PersonModelAdapter` is generated by the annotation processor! When the data
model classes change, the adapter is regenerated when we rebuild the project!

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    recyclerView.apply {
      layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this@MainActivity)
      adapter = PersonModelAdapter(listOf(
        Person("John Doe", "123 Street"),
        Person("Jane Doe", "789 Street")
      ))
    }
  }
}
```

## Using reflection to access the generated classes

Note that we are explicitly using `PersonModelAdapter` here, which means we must know of the existence of this class by
memory, which is not optimal.

We can also get this via reflection! Just by knowing that we are looking for the generated adapter class for the
`PersonModel` class (which we have written and know of), we can find it via reflection, knowing that this adapter must
also take a `List` as a parameter to its constructor. All of this logic is the `AdapterUtils.createBindingForModel()`
function. Here's what the usage of that code looks like.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    recyclerView.apply {
      layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this@MainActivity)
    }
    bindPersonModelAdapter()
  }

  private fun bindPersonModelAdapter() {
    val items = listOf(
        PersonModel("Jane Doe", "123 Street"),
        PersonModel("John Doe", "789 Street")
    )
    val adapter = AdapterUtils.createBindingForModel(PersonModel::class.java, items)
    adapter?.apply {
      recyclerView.adapter = this as RecyclerView.Adapter<*>
    }
  }
}
```

## Generating a static index of all the usages of our annotations in our codebase

As a bonus we also get an index of all the classes in our project that use our annotations! In the `MainActivity` code
above, instead of calling the `bindPersonModelAdapter()` function, we can call the following.

```kotlin
  private fun bindDebugModelAdapter() {
    val items: MutableList<DebugModel> = mutableListOf()
    AdapterIndex().index.map { classAnnotationHolder ->
      val title: String = classAnnotationHolder.name
      val description: String = classAnnotationHolder.list.joinToString(",", "{", "}") { it.name }
      items.add(DebugModel(title, description))
    }
    val adapter = AdapterUtils.createBindingForModel(DebugModel::class.java, items)
    adapter?.apply {
      recyclerView.adapter = this as RecyclerView.Adapter<*>
    }
  }
```

The index is statically generated at compile time, so there's no runtime overhead of using some kind of expensive
[classgraph](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/wiki/Code-examples) or reflection. The `index.AdapterIndex` file
contains the statically generated index of all the places in our code where our annotation is used. And if you call
`bindDebugModelAdapter()` then you will see all the places where our annotations are used in the code to build the
sample app itself ðŸ˜².

# Annotation processing

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the core concepts.

- Annotation processing is a tool built into javac for scanning and processing annotations at compile time.
- It can create new source files; however, it canâ€™t modify existing ones.
- Itâ€™s done in rounds. The first round starts when the compilation reaches the pre-compile phase. If this round
  generates any new files, another round starts with the generated files as its input. This continues until the
  processor processes all the new files.

# Project structure

This project has 3 modules:

- `app` - contains the Activity and RecyclerView (and uses the annotations defined below). The "data model" class is in
  this module and the annotations are actually used on classes here. Eg: `PersonModel` and `DebugModel`.
- `annotations` - contains the custom annotations that we've defined. There are two annotations, one at a class level,
  and the other at a property level (of the properties enclosed by the class).
- `processor` - contains the actual processor that generates the source files on compile.
  1. The processor looks for the class level annotation and enclosed property level annotations, and gathers the
     metadata from them in the `metadata.kt` classes.
  2. The metadata is then passed to the `codegen.kt` classes in order to generate the RecyclerView adapter corresponding
     to the data model.
  3. When you build the project, the generated files can be found in the following folder:
     `${buildDir.absolutePath}/generated/source/kotlin`.
     - The actual adapter files that generated here are: `PersonModelAdapter.kt` and `DebugModelAdapter.kt`.
     - Also, a static index file is generated in the `index` package/folder, called `AdapterIndex.kt`.
  4. `AdapterUtils.kt` is provided in this package as well, which handles providing a way to access the index and any
     generated model adapters via reflection.

There is a bunch of glue that enables annotation processing in the `build.gradle.kts` files of each of these modules. In
summary:

1. The annotations have to be imported in various modules.
2. The processor has to be run as well by the `app` module.

# Building an index of annotated classes

There are times when it would be useful to find all the classes that are annotated w/ a particular annotation. For a
made up example, in our activity, instead of populating the RecyclerView adapter w/ dummy data, we could have found all
the classes and methods where our annotations appear in the code, and then display that in the list.

Sadly, in Android due to the way in which DEX files work, it's not as easy as it would be in a normal JVM. Libraries
like [classgraph](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph) fail to work on Android. And there are hacks to scan DEX
files to find annotated classes, but those
[are slow and dangerous to use](https://bravenewgeek.com/implementing-spring-like-classpath-scanning-in-android/).

Currently we have `AdapterIndexGeneratorBuidler.kt` which actually does just this, but at compile time. Here's what the
output of this class looks like for this project (in the generated `index.AdapterIndex.kt` file).

```kotlin
package index

class AdapterIndex {
  val index: MutableList<ClassAnnotationHolder> = mutableListOf()

  init {
    index.add(ClassAnnotationHolder("DebugModelAdapter", mutableListOf()).apply {
      list.add(PropertyAnnotationHolder("title"))
      list.add(PropertyAnnotationHolder("description"))
    })
    index.add(ClassAnnotationHolder("PersonModelAdapter", mutableListOf()).apply {
      list.add(PropertyAnnotationHolder("name"))
      list.add(PropertyAnnotationHolder("address"))
    })

  }

  data class PropertyAnnotationHolder(
      val name: String
  )

  data class ClassAnnotationHolder(
      val name: String,
      val list: MutableList<PropertyAnnotationHolder>
  )
}
```

# Using reflection to load the adapter classes, given the model classes

ButterKnife is the inspiration of this feature, where you have to set it in motion by calling `bind(this)`. Even when
classes are generated, they won't "activate" until they are referenced from someplace.

So at some point, the code using the generated code has to make a call to load the generated class. In our activity,
this happens when `PersonModelAdapter` is directly referenced. But this is not optimal.

Perhaps a better way would be one by ButterKnife used in this
[nice example here](https://emo-pass.com/2017/11/26/builing-things-with-java-reflection-and-annotation-processing/). It
uses reflection and annotation processing in order to work. Here's the
[code for the `bind()` method](https://github.com/quangctkm9207/prefpin/blob/master/prefpin/src/main/java/prefpin/PrefPin.java#L42).

We can achieve this type of behavior in this project, and the code for this is in `codegen.AdapterUtils.kt`. If you look
at how the following methods `bindPersonModelAdapter` and `bindDebugModelAdapter` are used in the sections above you can
get a sense for the ergonomics of this approach vs knowing the generated class name ahead of time.

There's a reflective way to load the `AdapterIndex` shown above as well. Here's the code.

```kotlin
  private fun bindDebugModelAdapter() {
    val items: MutableList<DebugModel> = mutableListOf()
    AdapterUtils.getAdapterIndex()?.apply {
      (this as AdapterIndex).index.map { classAnnotationHolder ->
        val title: String = classAnnotationHolder.name
        val description: String = classAnnotationHolder.list.joinToString(",", "{", "}") { it.name }
        items.add(DebugModel(title, description))
      }
      val adapter = AdapterUtils.createBindingForModel(DebugModel::class.java, items)
      adapter?.apply {
        recyclerView.adapter = this as RecyclerView.Adapter<*>
      }
    }
  }
```

# Converting Groovy scripts to Kotlin DSL

The Groovy gradle files have been converted to Kotlin DSL. Also, note that there are very few files in `buildSrc` that
contain variables about dependencies and version numbers. These are updated by Android Studio, and putting them in
variables defeats Studio's efforts to automatically upgrade these for you, so it's best to keep it really simple for
simple projects like this one.

1. You can learn more about how to migrate from Groovy to Kotlin DSL
   [here](https://proandroiddev.com/the-new-way-of-writing-build-gradle-with-kotlin-dsl-script-8523710c9670).
2. Here's a KTS script to automate the Groovy file to Kotlin DSL
