## Introduction
<a id="markdown-introduction" name="introduction"></a>

I've provided scripts for setting up a new Ubuntu 24.04 desktop machine. They have been
tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. They contain all the software that is
needed for Rust development, OBS Studio use, and general developer productivity. They are
highly opinionated for my use case, but you can modify them to suit your needs. I've also
recently migrated from Pop_OS! 22.04.

<a id="markdown-related-video" name="related-video"></a>

This video shows what the scripts do after you run them, and how they make your Ubuntu
24.04 desktop environment look and feel. This article is really a companion to the video.

> ðŸ’¡ You can get the scripts from the
> [`rust-scratch`](https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/tree/main/ubuntu24) repo.

## What comes with the scripts
<a id="markdown-what-comes-with-the-scripts" name="what-comes-with-the-scripts"></a>

Here is a non exhaustive list of software that will be installed:

1. `fish` as the default login shell. All the configuration scripts are written in `fish`.
    `bass` is also installed to allow for running `bash` scripts in `fish`.
2. `rustup`, `brew`, and `flatpak` with `flathub` as package managers.
3. `docker` and `docker-compose` for containerization.
4. `obs-studio` for screen recording and streaming.
5. `vlc`, `mpv` for media playback.
6. `chrome` for web browsing.
7. `vscode` for code editing.
8. Lots of Gnome extensions for desktop customization.
9. `nerd-fonts` for terminal font customization. Along with `guake` and `tilix` for
    terminal emulators. Along with `tmux` for terminal multiplexing.

> To download Ubuntu 24.04, visit the [Ubuntu
> website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and prepare a USB drive with the ISO file
> for installation. You can use [Popsicle](https://flathub.org/apps/com.system76.Popsicle)
> to create a bootable USB drive.

## Running the scripts
<a id="markdown-running-the-scripts" name="running-the-scripts"></a>

Lots of customized font configurations are included in the scripts. You can clone the repo
and run the scripts, or just copy the links below and run them in your terminal.

You can run the following commands to get this on your machine. The first script
`0-bootstrap.bash` has to be installed first. It installs `fish` shell and makes it the
default and installs `flatpak` and `flatpak flathub`. It also installs `bass` to allow
running bash scripts in fish. The remainder of the scripts can be run in any order.

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl git
cd ~/Downloads/
git clone https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/
cd rust-scratch/ubuntu24/
./0-bootstrap.bash
# You will need to reboot after running the 0-bootstrap.bash script
```

Once you reboot, you can run the following scripts.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/rust-scratch/ubuntu24/
./1-install.fish
./2-install-docker.bash
./3-install-fonts.fish
```

You can see the contents of the scripts by clicking on the links below:

2. <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/main/ubuntu24/1-install.fish>
3. <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/main/ubuntu24/2-install-docker.bash>
4. <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/main/ubuntu24/3-install-fonts.fish>

## Keyboard remapping
<a id="markdown-keyboard-remapping" name="keyboard-remapping"></a>

### Tilix and quake mode
<a id="markdown-tilix-and-quake-mode" name="tilix-and-quake-mode"></a>

`tilix` and its `quake mode` is disabled in Wayland. So I installed `guake`. You can use
[`tmux`](https://lukaszwrobel.pl/blog/tmux-tutorial-split-terminal-windows-easily/) to
manage the panes in this `guake` terminal with ease.

### Remap Super+Q
<a id="markdown-remap-super%2Bq" name="remap-super%2Bq"></a>

The following links show you how to remove the default binding for the <kbd>Super+Q</kbd>
key to close the current window. This is useful if you want to use that binding to launch
the `guake` terminal. I used to use `tilix` in `quake mode`, but that doesn't work in
Wayland, so I am using `guake` for that now. But I'm still using `tilix`.

### Remap Caps Lock to Ctrl
<a id="markdown-remap-caps-lock-to-ctrl" name="remap-caps-lock-to-ctrl"></a>

Here's a snippet to allow you map your <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key to the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
key:

```bash
function remapCapsLockKey
    echo "Remapping caps lock key"
    # https://opensource.com/article/21/5/remap-caps-lock-key-linux
    dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options "['caps:ctrl_modifier']"
    # dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options "['caps:ctrl']"
end
```

## Chrome issues w/ Wayland
<a id="markdown-chrome-issues-w%2F-wayland" name="chrome-issues-w%2F-wayland"></a>

If you find Chrome to be blurry (or AppImages or Electron apps), then you may need to
do the following to fix this in Wayland:

- Navigate to `chrome://flags`
- Change `Preferred Ozone Platform` from `default` to `wayland`
- [More info](https://askubuntu.com/a/1502896/872482)

## libfuse2 and AppImage issues
<a id="markdown-libfuse2-and-appimage-issues" name="libfuse2-and-appimage-issues"></a>

On Ubuntu 24.04 I ran into some issues w/ `libfuse2` and running `AppImage`s.

- Ubuntu 24 does not come w/ `libfuse2` out of the box (for good reasons), and instead it
  has `libfuse3`.
- And `AppImage` currently only supports `libfuse2`.

### Approach 1 - simple
<a id="markdown-approach-1---simple" name="approach-1---simple"></a>

Instead of installing `libfuse2`, however, if you donâ€™t want to do that you can simply run
the your `XYZ.AppImage` using the following command (once it's been marked as executable):

```
chmod +x XYZ.AppImage
./XYZ.AppImage \
  --no-sandbox --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WaylandWindowDecorations \
  --ozone-platform-hint=auto
```

Explanation of the flags:

- `--no-sandbox` - removes the need for libfuse2
- `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WaylandWindowDecorations` - tells chromium in
  electron to do things for Wayland.
- `--ozone-platform-hint=auto` - tells chromium to use Wayland if it is available. This
  setting is set to `X11` by default. If you see blurry windows in Chrome, you may need to set
  this in your Chrome too (using `chrome://flags/`).

Hereâ€™s an example of my `~/.local/share/applications/uhk-agent.desktop` file, which I use
to run the [`uhk-agent`
AppImage](https://forum.ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/t/run-agent-appimage-in-wayland-eg-on-ubuntu-24/1364)
w/ the above flags:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=UHK Agent
Comment=Launch UHK Agent
Categories=Utilities;
Icon=/home/nazmul/bin/uhk-agent.png
Exec=/home/nazmul/bin/UHK.Agent.AppImage --no-sandbox --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,WaylandWindowDecorations --ozone-platform-hint=auto
Terminal=false
```

### Approach 2 - complex
<a id="markdown-approach-2---complex" name="approach-2---complex"></a>

Here's another approach to run `AppImage`s, which is more complex:

- [`libfuse2`](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE) is not included with
  Ubuntu 24.04. `AppImage`s are difficult to run (since they need `libfuse2` installed).
- To run them, have to pass an extra flag in the terminal or `.desktop` file(eg for
  `uhk-agent`). here's a workaround (to keep from installing `libfuse2`).

Here's an example of the command to run the [`uhk-agent`
AppImage](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/agent):

```bash
/UHK.Agent-4.2.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
cd squashfs-root
./uhk-agent --no-sandox
```

Here's a
[script](https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/blob/main/ubuntu24/install-agent-into-bin.fish)
that uses this complex approach to unpack an `AppImage` into the `~/bin` folder so you can
run it.

## Settings -> Key mappings
<a id="markdown-settings--%3E-key-mappings" name="settings--%3E-key-mappings"></a>

- To create keyboard shortcuts that launch a shell command, wrap it in `sh -c $CMD`. This
  is what must be done for `flameshot`, and `ulauncher`.
- Bind `ulauncher-toggle` to the settings -> keyboard shortcuts in gnome.

## OBS Studio issues
<a id="markdown-obs-studio-issues" name="obs-studio-issues"></a>

`obs-studio` has some UI issues, and dialog boxes are quite glitchy and don't display
properly. keyboard shortcuts can't be reliably used when the `obs-studio` window is not in
focus. can't really bind to settings -> keyboard shortcuts either, since there's no
command to stop recording; start recording will spawn a new process.

## Fontconfig
<a id="markdown-fontconfig" name="fontconfig"></a>

Custom font install using script. optional - `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf` change
for system fonts that affect all apps. also `gnome-tweaks` to change fonts, and other
settings.
