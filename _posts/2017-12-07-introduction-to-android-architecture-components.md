## Put the magic back into Android development

In Nov 2017 Architecture Components v1 was
[launched](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/release-notes.html#release_candidate_-_october_18_2017).
This is a big deal because for the longest time it was very difficult to deal with certain use cases
which would crop up all the time in mobile app development.

Things like dealing with configuration changes when rotating a screen, and sharing app state data
between fragments and activities were difficult.

While these difficulties are not insurmountable, the fact that they crop up in so many common
scenarios have had a negative impact on the developer experience on Android and didn‚Äôt make it feel
magical. üò†

Architecture Components puts the magic back into Android development! üé©‚ú® This article has both
[Java](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp) and
[Kotlin](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp_kt) versions of a sample project that I
build to illustrate the use of Architecture Components.

## What is it?

There are quite a few patterns out there for app architectures, such as MVP, MVVM, and
unidirectional. I‚Äôm a huge fan of
[unidirectional](https://developerlife.com/2017/01/27/native-android-redux-and-firebase/), and I
like MVVM too. There are 3 parts of M-V-VM, the `Model`, `View`, and `ViewModel`. Let‚Äôs take a look
at what each of these are.

### View

This is the UI component that is in a layout and rendered on the display.

### ViewModel

`Views` subscribe to the data they are interested in from the `ViewModel`. So when this data changes
it can be broadcast to any interested observers.

- The `ViewModel` is responsible for prearing data for consumption by the View.
- The `ViewModel‚Äôs` state is stable across the lifecycle of `Activities` and `Fragments`. So as an
  Activity is torn down and rebuilt (on an orientation change) it can use the same `ViewModel`. And
  you can scope the lifetime of these `ViewModels` to the `Activity` lifetime as well, so that when
  the `Activity` is finished (not destroyed), then the `ViewModel` can be cleaned up.
- `LiveData` is an interesting piece of a `ViewModel` that you can wrap any data that changes quite
  rapidly and these changes have to be reflected in UI components.
- `ViewModels` should not hold references to any `Views`. And if they need an `ApplicationContext`,
  then you can use `AndroidViewModel` which supplies this.
- You don‚Äôt directly create a `ViewModel`, instead you ask the system to find you one. And the
  system ends up creating the `ViewModel` and managing what it‚Äôs scope is based on this. Basically
  you have to use a factory method to get a reference to a `ViewModel` instead of just creating one
  yourself using a constructor.

### Model

This is where your underlying data is actually stored. The model can be backed by local persistence
stores, and synchronized with remote data sources. You can use `Room` to make it easier to work with
`SQLLite` (on device) and have `Room` generate the ORM layer for you. Or you can use Firebase for
persistence, which automagically syncs its state across multiple platforms. You have a lot of
flexibility in what you choose. You can even use something like `Redux` in addition to Firebase to
be your `Model`.

This article is focused on the
[`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html#implement)
and [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) parts of
the Architecture Components. I will be covering
[Lifecycle awareness](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle.html) and
`Models` in other articles.

## Example

I‚Äôve created a simple app that showcases how you might use a `ViewModel` and `LiveData` in your
apps. You can get this sample on [GitHub](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp).

The sample just has 1 `Java` file ‚Äî
[`MainActivity.java`](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp/blob/main/app/src/main/java/arch_comp/android/example/com/architecturecomponents/MainActivity.java).
This `Activity` loads its state from a `StateViewModel`, which contains two pieces of data. Here‚Äôs
the entire `Activity`.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private TextView dataTextView;
    private TextView counterTextView;
    private StateViewModel stateViewModel;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        dataTextView = findViewById(R.id.data_textview);
        counterTextView = findViewById(R.id.counter_textview);
        setupModelView();
        attachObservers();
    }

    // Deal with loading state from ViewModel
    private void setupModelView() {
        stateViewModel =
            ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(StateViewModel.class);
        dataTextView.setText(
                String.format("Data: %s", stateViewModel.getData()));
    }

    private void attachObservers() {
        stateViewModel
                .getCounter()
                .observe(
                        this,
                        count -> {
                            counterTextView.setText(
                                    String.format("Count: %s",
                                    Long.toString(count)));
                        });
    }
}
```

### Data # 1

There‚Äôs a `UUID` `String` that is generate the first time this `StateViewModel` is created and this
is displayed in the UI. This `String` does not change for the lifetime of the `Activity`. It is
stable across configuration changes. So as you rotate the screen, and the Activity is destroyed and
then recreated (but not finished), the same `UUID` `String` will be displayed in the UI. When you
finish the Activity by pressing the back button, or by going to the task switcher and swiping the
`Activity` away, then the `ViewModel` will be destroyed and `onCleared()` will be called.

```java
class StateViewModel extends AndroidViewModel {
    private final ScheduledExecutorService myExecutor;
    // This value doesn't change after it is initialized
    private String mData;
    // This value changes over time
    private CounterLiveData mCounter = new CounterLiveData();

    public StateViewModel(Application context) {
        super(context);
        myExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
        myExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(
                this::recurringTask, 0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        Log.d(Tags.viewmodel.name(),
            "ViewModel constructor: created executor");
    }

    // Counter
    public void recurringTask() {
        long counter = mCounter.get();
        Log.d(Tags.viewmodel.name(),
            counter % 2 == 0 ? "task: tick" : "task: tock");
        mCounter.set(counter + 1);
    }

    public CounterLiveData getCounter() {
        return mCounter;
    }

    // Data
    public void setData(String mData) {
        this.mData = mData;
    }

    public String getData() {
        if (isDataSet()) {
            Toast.makeText(getApplication(),
                "Re-using ViewModel", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        } else {
            setData(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
            Toast.makeText(getApplication(),
                "This is a new ViewModel", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
        return mData;
    }

    public boolean isDataSet() {
        return mData != null;
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCleared() {
        super.onCleared();
        myExecutor.shutdown();
        Log.d(Tags.viewmodel.name(), mCounter.toString());
        Log.d(Tags.viewmodel.name(),
            "onCleared: lifecycle of activity finished");
    }
}
```

### Data # 2

The `ViewModel` also creates a `ScheduledExecutor` that runs a simple task every second. This task
simply updates a counter, and it generates a log message (‚Äú`tick`‚Äù, or ‚Äú`tock`‚Äù). This Executor also
sets the value of this counter in a `CounterLiveData` object. The UI actually subscribes to this
`LiveData` object and when it changes the UI gets updated with the current count. This too is stable
across configuration changes. When the `Activity` is finally finished, the `onCleared()` method
actually shuts the executor down. Also, you have to be mindful of which thread the
`CounterLiveData‚Äôs` value is set.

```java
class CounterLiveData extends MutableLiveData<Long> {
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("count=%d", getValue());
    }

    public Long get() {
        return getValue() == null ? 0L : getValue();
    }

    public void set(Long value) {
        if (Looper.getMainLooper().equals(Looper.myLooper())) {
            // UI thread
            setValue(value);
        } else {
            // Non UI thread
            postValue(value);
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding Architecture Components to your project

Read more about how to modify your `build.gradle` file on
[developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/adding-components.html).
Here‚Äôs a simple `build.gradle` file snippet just for `Lifecycles`, `ViewModel`, and `LiveData`.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')
    // Support lib
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.0.2'

    // Lifecycles
    implementation "android.arch.lifecycle:runtime:1.0.3"
    annotationProcessor "android.arch.lifecycle:compiler:1.0.0"
    implementation "android.arch.lifecycle:common-java8:1.0.0"

    // ViewModel, LiveData
    implementation "android.arch.lifecycle:extensions:1.0.0"
}
```

## The Kotlin version

You can find the Kotlin version of this project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp_kt). The Kotlin version is similar in
spirit, but the code is very very different. I recently learned Kotlin (in Dec 2017) and have used
it so far in [Android](https://github.com/nazmulidris/android_arch_comp_kt),
[Web](https://github.com/nazmulidris/kotlinserver_jvm), and
[JavaScript](https://github.com/nazmulidris/kotlinserver_js) projects.

![android-arch-comp-kt]({{ 'assets/android-arch-comp-kt.gif' | relative_url }})

Kotlin is a very different project from Java or JavaScript, and it took me a while to become fluent
‚Äúthinking in Kotlin‚Äù. In this project, I used both Kotlin for Android and
[Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko). Anko is a delightful library that made so much mundane
boilerplate disappear from the codebase. I am going to highlight some of the major changes between
the Java version and Kotlin version of the projects below.

### UI - ConstraintLayout

This really has nothing to do with Kotlin. I decided to go with
[ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/index.html#adjust-the-constraint-bias)
for the Kotlin version. The biggest learning about ConstraintLayout came from using
[guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37318228/how-to-make-constraintlayout-work-with-percentage-values)
to position my components and setting width/height to `0dp` for `match_constraint`.

![]({{ 'assets/android-arch-comp-ui.png' | relative_url }})

### UI - Downloadable Fonts

I‚Äôm a big fan of
[downloadable fonts](https://proandroiddev.com/android-downloadable-fonts-8e60d3e146b7). The Kotlin
version of the code is quite different from the Java version in many ways. I also use Anko to take
care of some nasty view traversal (to set the `Typeface` on the `Toolbar`). AnkoLogger is also a
great thing to avoid having to create a `TAG` for log message generation.

To use Anko logger, you have to make your class implement the `AnkoLogger`interface. Then you can
just call `info()` or `wft()`, etc to generate logs without using a `TAG`.

```kotlin
class FontObserver(val mContext: Context, val mToolbar: Toolbar) :
    LifecycleObserver, AnkoLogger {
  @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_CREATE)
  fun downloadFont() {
      info("${::downloadFont.name}(): Running") ... }
... }
```

You can use Anko to take care of some gnarly view traversal.

```kotlin
fun styleToolbar(typeface: Typeface) {
    mToolbar.applyRecursively {
        when (it) {
            is TextView -> it.typeface = typeface
        }
    }
}
```

And with the `lazy` delegate, you can create heavy objects with ease (without having to deal with
`null` checking). The `with` extension function makes things neat so that I don‚Äôt have to create
clumsy local variables.

```kotlin
val mFontHandler: Handler by lazy {
    with(HandlerThread("fonts")) {
        start()
        Handler(looper)
    }
}
```

### UI - No more findViewById

This is one of my favorite
[Kotlin for Android](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html) extensions! You can
reference the `id` of your `Views` directly in your code without doing clunky and possibly leaky
`findViewById()` calls (Kotlin maintains a
[view cache](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html#view-caching) for you to make
this syntactic sugar performant and reliable as well).

```kotlin
// No need to use findViewById() anymore!
fun viewBinding() {
    // Use synthetic properties on views!
    data_textview.text = "Data!!!"
    counter_textview.text = "Counter!!!"
}
```

### UI - Toasts

Anko makes it a breeze to work with `Toasts`, with the extension function `toast(String)`. You will
be glad to know that you don‚Äôt have to call `show()`for this Toast to actually be visible! Only
caveat is that this function is defined on a `Context` object, so if you‚Äôre not in a `Context`, or
`Fragment`, etc then you have to call this function on a `Context` reference. Here‚Äôs an example of
calling a `toast()` from the `StateViewModel` class.

```kotlin
var mData: Data
    get() {
        if (!::_data.isInitialized) {
            getApplication<Application>()
                .toast("Creating new ViewModel")
            _data = Data(Random().nextInt(1000).toString(), Date())
        }
        return _data
    }
    set(mData) {
        _data = mData
    }
```

### UI - Snackbar

Anko makes it easy to work with `Snackbars` with the extension function `snackbar(View, String)`.
It‚Äôs very similar to `toast()` except that you need to provide one `View` in the layout in which you
want the Snackbar to appear. IN order to get a View that you can use, call
`findViewById(**android.R.id.content**)`. This will get you the top level view in whatever `View`
hierarchy you‚Äôve inflated. You can then use this `View` to create a `Snackbar`.

```kotlin
val rootView: View = findViewById(android.R.id.content)
snackbar(rootView, "MainActivity created")
```

### UI - Alert

Anko makes it easy to work with `Dialogs` as well with the `alert()` extension function. Here‚Äôs an
example of this.

```kotlin
fun showDialog(rootView: View) {
    if (::mStateViewModel.isInitialized)
        if (!mStateViewModel.mData.clicked)
            alert(
                    Appcompat,
                    title = "Welcome ü§ó",
                    message = "Make sure to rotate screen ...",
                    init = {
                        okButton {
                            mStateViewModel.mData.clicked = true
                            snackbar(rootView, "üëç")
                            info("üëç was selected")
                        }
                        noButton {
                            mStateViewModel.mData.clicked = true
                            snackbar(rootView, "üëé")
                            info("üëé was selected")
                        }
                        onCancelled {
                            mStateViewModel.mData.clicked = true
                            snackbar(rootView, "üëä")
                            info("üëä dialog was dismissed")
                        }
                    }
            ).show()
}
```

### ViewModel - StateViewModel

When your `Activity` is created, you can call the following to get a reference to the `ViewModel`.
Note that we are using a `AndroidViewModel` in this case (which comes with a reference to the
`Application` `Context`). Also remember that you can‚Äôt directly instantiate the `ViewModel`, Android
will do this for you.

```kotlin
mStateViewModel = ViewModelProviders
     .of(this)
     .get(StateViewModel::class.java)
```

Once you‚Äôve got the ViewModel, you can use the properties it exposes ‚Äî `mData: Data` and
`mCounter: Counter`.

Here‚Äôs an example of setting the text of `mData‚Äôs` `toString()` to a `TextView`.

```kotlin
data_textview.text = mStateViewModel.mData.toString()
```

Here‚Äôs are examples of attaching `Observers` to `mData` and `mCounter`. Both `Data` and `Counter`
classes are subclasses of `LiveData`.

```kotlin
mStateViewModel.mCounter.observe(
            this,
            Observer {
                counter_textview.text = "Count: ${it.toString()}"
            })
```

```kotlin
mStateViewModel.mData.observe(
            this,
            Observer {
                data_textview.text = it.toString()
            }
    )
```

### LiveData - Counter

The `Counter` subclass of `LiveData` exposes one public property `count` and one function
`increment()`. These are used in order to increment the `count` by 1 every second, by the `Executor`
thread that‚Äôs started in the `StateViewModel`. You can pass an initial value of the counter via the
constructor. There‚Äôs also an `init` block that takes this value and sets it on the `LiveData`.

```kotlin
init {
    setValue(value)
}
```

The `count` property is backed by `private value: Int`. This means that the count itself doesn‚Äôt
really store the `Int` value. However it‚Äôs setter and getter are used in order to expose the value
of count to other classes. Additionally, when the setter is used, this causes the `LiveData`
`setValue()`/`postValue()`to be called as well.

```kotlin
var count: Long
    get() {
        return value
    }
    set(value) {
        if (Looper.getMainLooper() == Looper.myLooper()) {
            // UI thread
            setValue(value)
        } else {
            // Non UI thread
            postValue(value)
        }
    }
```

The `increment()` method actually increments the `value` and then sets it on the `count` property
itself. This results in a call to `setValue()` / `postValue()`as shown above, which is what makes
this an `Observable`.

```kotlin
fun increment() {
    count = value++
}
```

### LiveData - Data

The `Data` subclass of `LiveData` exposes one property ‚Äî `clicked`. This property is set when the
user interacts with the alert / dialog shown above.

```kotlin
data class Data(val id: String, val time: Date) :
        MutableLiveData<Data>() {

    private var _clicked: Boolean = false
    var clicked: Boolean
        get() {
            return _clicked
        }
        set(value) {
            _clicked = value
            setValue(this)
        }
... }
```
